With the huge potential to benefit users in multiple scenarios (e.g., gaming, education, design, and healthcare), Spatial Computing is growing at an incredible rate, with different attempts to define and capitalize on the growth in both industry and academia. Beyond the location, shape, and relationship of geographic objects, Spatial Computing delves into the social, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of shared spaces. However, the human-computer interaction research on Spatial Computing faces a notable gap, particularly in user experience areas like collaboration, trust, ethics, and accessibility.

We present a novel conceptual framework for improving disaster resilience through the combination of serious games, geographic information systems (GIS), spatial thinking, and disaster resilience. Our framework is implemented via Project Lily Pad, a serious geogame based on our conceptual framework, serious game case studies, interviews and real-life experiences from 2017 Hurricane Harvey survivors in Dickinson, TX, and an immersive hurricane-induced flooding scenario. The game teaches a four-fold set of skills relevant to spatial thinking and disaster resilience, including reading a map, navigating an environment, coding verbal instructions, and determining best practices in a disaster situation. Results of evaluation of the four skills via Project Lily Pad through a \u201cthink aloud\u201d study conducted by both emergency management novices and professionals revealed that the game encouraged players to think spatially, can help build awareness for disaster response scenarios, and has potential for real-life use by emergency management professionals. It can be concluded from our results that the combination of serious games, geographic information systems (GIS), spatial thinking, and disaster resilience, as implemented via Project Lily Pad and our evaluation results, demonstrated the wide range of possibilities for using serious geogames to improve disaster resilience spatial thinking and potentially save lives when disasters occur.",

We conducted a spatial think-aloud study with ten participants new to crisis response who used SerGIS with a coastal city hurricane scenario. Four themes emerged from participant responses: processes of reasoning, tools of representation, overlay and dissolve operation, and geographic information concept learning and knowledge gaps. The first three themes match directly with the spatial thinking theory and evaluation underlying SerGIS. The fourth theme identified addresses GIS and spatial thinking crisis response educational issues. Furthermore, statistical evidence indicates there is likely a relationship between participants from spatially-oriented backgrounds (but with no GIS experience) performing better with SerGIS than participants from non-spatial backgrounds. Finally, we found that with a game scenario based on established disaster management practitioner literature, participants could focus on spatial thinking tasks and not be limited by understanding the game scenario itself.",

In response to the increasing need for advanced studies in forensics, we propose game-based modules using the game-based learning approach that enable first-year students to learn basic digital forensics concepts without pre-requisite knowledge. This paper focuses on the design and development of an interactive game framework and the educational digital forensics modules that will be plugged into the game framework in a real computing environment. In contrast to the traditional teaching approaches, this modular approach will use game-based learning and visualization techniques to engage students to learn abstract concepts and to explore forensics investigation technologies and procedures through interactive games.

RIT\u2019s first seminar in alternative game controller design introduced students to game input mechanisms and encouraged innovation. By working with hardware, students explored physical design issues to improve their overall game design skills. The course demonstrated early success, as evidenced by the 2009 Game Developers Conference in which a banjo controller and game created by the students garnered accolades. To help other instructors develop a similar course, this paper addresses the motivation for, and components, of the course design. By combining elements of reverse engineering, interfaces, and game design, students can indeed design and successfully make custom game controllers. The paper contains a summary of one of the two final student projects: a deformable surface. The postmortem notes that despite the course success, future versions will need more time for projects. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions",

The game industry has influenced reverse engineering law and practice, challenging ethical practices in industry, academia, and with end-users. Although these communities supposedly rely on legal precedents, actual laws are often misunderstood, ignored, or just unknown. The communities continually struggle to balance the protection of intellectual property with consumer freedom, and reverse engineering demonstrates this conflict. We demonstrate how a variety of communities embrace reverse engineering through a series of case studies involving current commercial games and technology.

The paper derives a functional mathematical relationship between temporal game state and score, which provides a foundation for addressing computational issues of games. Scoring functions can provide analytical tools for game analysis by measuring continuous and discrete game state. These tools may assist with game design, analysis, and balancing. Linking game creation with computational analysis could provide an excellent context to integrate mathematics at early stages of education.

The application of a set-based qualitative algebra to matrix analysis (QMA) allows for the development of a qualitative matrix stiffness methodology for linear elastic structural analysis. The unavoidable introduction of arithmetic ambiguity requires the reinforcement of physical constraints complementary to standard matrix operations. The overall analysis technique incorporates such constraints within the set-based framework with logic programming. Truss, beam, and frame structures demonstrate constraint relationships, which prune spurious solutions resulting from qualitative arithmetic relations. Though QMA is not a panacea for all structural applications, it provides greater insight into new notions of physical analysis.",

It is the authors' contention that such reasoning can be rendered in a computational manner and that Interval Analysis (IA) provides the mathematical foundations to do so.Using Interval Analysis, the notion of operations with numbers is replaced with operations on sets of numbers. Representation of structural parameters with sets of known values permits a simultaneous parametric study. Using concepts from Qualitative and Order of Magnitude Reasoning, interval methods are augmented to perform levels of both qualitative and quantitative mechanical reasoning. Whereby interval techniques employ tight numerical intervals, it is\u00a0\u2026",

Qualitative Matrix Analysis (QMA), shows promise for accommodating a variety of structural models within a uniform mathematical framework:. QMA currently leads to combinatorial ambiguities when applied to, structures of realistic complexity. To curtail ambiguity and provide a sense of magnitude to solutions, an interval based Order of Magnitude Reasoning approach is proposed. This paper describes the theory and prototype implementation of an interval-based matrix structural analysis scheme for Order of Magnitude Reasoning.",

Since September 15, a team composed of representatives from Campus Life, Academic Technology Services, the College of Engineering, and the Computer Science Department have been working towards clarifying the goals and issues associated with developing a cooperative computer lab. In particular, based on the recommendations of the design team, I have included portions in the modified proposal to show that the focus of the lab reaches beyond the introductory programming courses from which the idea was initially proposed. Pages 4\u20139 contain a majority of the updates, which consist of a discussion of current limitations, design modifications, and an extensive list of proposed uses for the lab. The current plan for the lab is shown on page 8."

It is important for the users to understand the basic concepts of NFTs before they engage in a virtual society or application that uses NFTs to represent digital assets. Traditional learning methods like reading articles are inefficient to support active learning of a new concept. In this work, we designed and developed a multi-user VR-based learning method that provides a learneroriented experience for users to create their own digital assets, witness the process of minting the assets into NFTs, and trade the NFTs. We conduct a study with participants to understand the learning efficiency of the VR-based method in comparing to the traditional reading-based method. The evaluation result shows that the multi-user experience was more engaging than a solo reading-based experience, and the participants became more motivated to learn about NFT topics in the VR experience."
