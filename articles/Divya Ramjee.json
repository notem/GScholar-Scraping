Understanding how public health communications evolve around key policy decisions may inform future decisions on preventative measures by aiding the design of communication strategies (eg, wording, timing, and channel) that ensure rapid dissemination and maximize both widespread adoption and sustained adherence. Objective We aimed to assess how sentiment on masks evolved surrounding 2 changes to mask guidelines: (1) the recommendation for mask use on April 3, 2020, and (2) the relaxation of mask use on May 13, 2021. Methods We applied an interrupted time series method to US Twitter data surrounding each guideline change. Outcomes were changes in the (1) proportion of positive, negative, and neutral tweets and (2) number of words within a tweet tagged with a given emotion (eg, trust). Results were compared to COVID-19 Twitter data without mask keywords for the same period. Results There were fewer neutral mask-related tweets in 2020 (\u03b2=\u20133.94 percentage points, 95% CI \u20134.68 to \u20133.21; P<.001) and 2021 (\u03b2=\u20138.74, 95% CI \u20139.31 to \u20138.17; P<.001).

        "description": "While forensic genealogy continues to gain popularity as a law enforcement tool for solving cold cases, discrepancies in testing and evidentiary standards, as well as ethical and privacy issues, continue to plague the practice. This Article examines the investigatory role of genetic information and the various methods by which genetic information can be collected, used, or shared, including by law enforcement. In the era of Big Data, we must understand the limitations posed by the reliability and accuracy of information included in private and publicly available genealogy databases and how those limitations compete with the desire to implement valid machine learning algorithms in the fields of criminology and law. Realizing that advancements in science often outpace regulatory legislation, this Article addresses ways in which private and publicly available genealogy services can safeguard genetic information\u00a0\u2026",

The deployment of privacy-invasive measures against protesters in public spaces has an extensive and storied history-one often rooted in racism and discrimination.'And while the technology may have changed, the purpose remains the same: to surveil, identify, and detain dissenters. 2",
