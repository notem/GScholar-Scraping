        "description": "Can we efficiently compute optimal solutions to instances of a hard problem from optimal solutions to neighbor instances, that is, instances with one local modification? For example, can we efficiently compute an optimal coloring for a graph from optimal colorings for all one-edge-deleted subgraphs? Studying such questions not only gives detailed insight into the structure of the problem itself, but also into the complexity of related problems, most notably, graph theory\u2019s core notion of critical graphs (e.g., graphs whose chromatic number decreases under deletion of an arbitrary edge) and the complexity-theoretic notion of minimality problems (also called criticality problems, e.g., recognizing graphs that become 3-colorable when an arbitrary edge is deleted). We focus on two prototypical graph problems, colorability and vertex cover. For example, we show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal coloring for a graph from optimal colorings for all its one-vertex-deleted subgraphs, and that this remains true even when optimal solutions for all one-edge-deleted subgraphs are given. In contrast, computing an optimal coloring from all (or even just two) one-edge-added supergraphs is in P. We observe that vertex cover exhibits a remarkably different behavior, demonstrating the power of our model to delineate problems from each other more precisely on a structural level. Moreover, we provide a number of new complexity results for minimality and criticality problems. For example, we prove that MINIMAL-3-UNCOLORABILITY is complete for  (differences of NP sets), which was previously known only for the more amenable case of deleting vertices rather than\u00a0\u2026"

We show that this case is in P, strengthening the recent RP (randomized polynomial-time) upper bound due to Fitzsimmons and Hemaspaandra (IJCAI 2022). We show this by transforming 2-Approval CCRV to weighted matching. We also use this approach to show that priced bribery for 2-Veto elections is in P.

The equivalence problem for NFAs is known to be PSPACE-complete, and several specialized algorithms have been developed to solve this problem. In this paper, we approach the equivalence problem for NFAs by means of another PSPACE-complete problem: quantified satisfiability (QSAT). QSAT asks whether a quantified Boolean formula (QBF) is true. We encode the NFA equivalence problem as a QBF which is true if and only if the input NFAs are not equivalent. In addition to determining the equivalence of NFAs, we are also able to decode strings that witness the inequivalence of two NFAs by looking into the solving certificate. This is a novel application of certified QSAT solving. Lastly, we formally verify key aspects of the encoding in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover."

However, in many real-world settings votes come in sequentially, and the briber may have a use-it-or-lose-it moment to decide whether to alter a given vote, and when making that decision the briber may not know what votes remaining voters will cast. We introduce a model for, and initiate the study of, bribery in such an online, sequential setting. We show that even for election systems whose winner-determination problem is polynomial-time computable, an online, sequential setting may vastly increase the complexity of bribery, jumping the problem up to completeness for high levels of the polynomial hierarchy or even PSPACE. But we also show that for some natural, important election systems, such a dramatic complexity increase does not occur, and we pinpoint the\u00a0\u2026",

This has been a successful first step for many problems, including voting problems. However, in this paper we show that this may not always be the best first step. We consider the problem of constructive control by replacing voters (CCRV) introduced by Loreggia et al. (2015) for the scoring rule First-Last, which is defined by . We show that this problem is equivalent to Exact Perfect Bipartite Matching, and so CCRV for First-Last can be determined in random polynomial time. So on the one hand, if CCRV for First-Last is NP-complete then RP = NP, which is extremely unlikely. On the other hand, showing that CCRV for First-Last is in P would also show that Exact Perfect Bipartite Matching is in P, which would solve a well-studied 40-year-old open problem. By considering RP as an option we also gain insight into the complexity of CCRV for 2-Approval, ultimately showing it in P, which settles the complexity of the sole open problem in the comprehensive table from Erd\\'{e}lyi et al.

Typically, however, the underlying graphs are subject to (often minor) changes. To make these applications of graph parameters robust, it is important to know which graphs are stable in the sense that adding or deleting single edges or vertices does not change them.

We study the complexity of consensus-related questions, with a particular focus on Kemeny and its qualitative version Slater. The simplest of these questions is the problem of determining whether a ranking is a consensus, and we show that this problem is coNP-complete. We also study the natural question of the complexity of manipulative actions that have a specific consensus as a goal. Though determining whether a ranking is a Kemeny consensus is hard, the optimal action for manipulators is to simply vote their desired consensus. We provide evidence that this simplicity is caused by the combination of election system (Kemeny), manipulative action (manipulation), and manipulative goal (consensus).

Students must master various computational models, but there is often a lengthy delay from the time a model is introduced until a student gets feedback on their related assignment. During this time, the course has typically moved far ahead, and students become progressively more lost. To alleviate this problem, we developed a prototype of an automated feedback tool for CS theory, which extends the widely used JFLAP software.

Our main result is that they probably do differ: If P \u2260 NP \u2229 coNP (which itself is well known to hold if integer factoring is hard), then for election manipulation, election bribery, and some types of election control, there are election systems for which the problem of recognizing which instances can be successfully manipulated is polynomial-time solvable, yet the task of producing the successful manipulations cannot be done in polynomial time.",

It would be natural to expect that computing the winner of an election is at least as hard as computing the score of a candidate. We show that this is not always the case. In particular, we show that for Young elections for dichotomous preferences the winner problem is easy, while determining the score of a candidate is hard. This complexity behavior has not been seen before and is unusual. The easiness of the winner problem for dichotomous Young crucially uses the fact that dichotomous preferences guarantee the transitivity of the majority relation. In addition to dichotomous preferences we also look at single-peaked preferences, the most well-studied domain restriction that guarantees the transitivity of the majority relation.

We consider how this representation affects the complexity of election problems. High-multiplicity representation may be exponentially smaller than standard representation, and so many polynomial-time algorithms for election problems in standard representation become exponential-time. Surprisingly, for polynomial-time election problems, we are often able to either adapt the same approach or provide new algorithms to show that these problems remain polynomial-time in the high-multiplicity case; this is in sharp contrast to the case where each voter has a weight, where the complexity usually increases.

For example, can we efficiently compute an optimal coloring for a graph from optimal colorings for all one-edge-deleted subgraphs? Studying such questions not only gives detailed insight into the structure of the problem itself, but also into the complexity of related problems; most notably graph theory's core notion of critical graphs (e.g., graphs whose chromatic number decreases under deletion of an arbitrary edge) and the complexity-theoretic notion of minimality problems (also called criticality problems, e.g., recognizing graphs that become 3-colorable when an arbitrary edge is deleted). We focus on two prototypical graph problems, Colorability and Vertex Cover. For example, we show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal coloring for a graph from optimal colorings for all its one-vertex-deleted subgraphs, and that this remains true even when optimal solutions for all one-edge-deleted subgraphs are given. In contrast, computing an optimal coloring from all (or even just two) one-edge-added supergraphs is in P. We observe that Vertex Cover exhibits a remarkably different behavior, demonstrating the power of our model to delineate problems from each other more precisely on a structural level. Moreover, we provide a number of new complexity results for minimality and criticality problems. For example, we prove that Minimal-3-UnColorability is complete for DP (differences of NP sets), which was previously known only for the more amenable case of deleting vertices rather than edges.

We show that the related problems can be much harder than in the standard (non-online) case: For certain election systems, even with efficient winner problems, online control by deleting, adding, or partitioning voters is -complete, even if there are only two candidates.

This paper develops a model for studying online control for elections where the structure is sequential with respect to the candidates, and in which the decision regarding adding and deleting must be irrevocably made at the moment the candidate is presented. We show that great complexity\u2014PSPACE-completeness\u2014can occur in this setting, but we also provide within this setting polynomial-time algorithms for the most important of election systems, plurality.",

By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial covering challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard bribery problems--including those for Kemeny and Llull elections--fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates. By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial partition challenges, we for the first time show that NP-hard partition-of-voters problems fall to polynomial time for single-peaked electorates.

We obtain the first dichotomy theorem for pure scoring rules for a control problem. In particular, for constructive control by adding voters (CCAV), we show that CCAV is solvable in polynomial time for k-approval with k<= 3, k-veto with k<= 2, every pure scoring rule in which only the two top-rated candidates gain nonzero scores, and a particular rule that is a\" hybrid\" of 1-approval and 1-veto. For all other pure scoring rules, CCAV is NP-complete.

Often voters have indifference between some of the candidates. In a weak preference order indifference must be transitive. We show that single-peaked consistency for weak orders is in P for three different variants of single-peakedness for weak orders. Specifically, we consider Black's original definition of single-peakedness for weak orders, Black's definition of single-plateaued preferences, and the existential model recently introduced by Lackner.

In this paper, we study the complexity of control attacks on elections in which there are manipulators. We study both the case where the \"chair\" who is seeking to control the election is allied with the manipulators, and the case where the manipulators seek to thwart the chair. In the latter case, we see that the order of play substantially influences the complexity. We prove upper bounds, holding over every election system with a polynomial-time winner problem, for all standard control cases, and some of these bounds are at the second or third level of the polynomial hierarchy, and we provide matching lower bounds to prove these tight. Nonetheless, for important natural systems the complexity can be much lower. We prove that for approval and plurality elections, the complexity of even competitive clashes between a controller and manipulators falls far below those high bounds, even as low as polynomial time. Yet for a Borda-voting case we show that such clashes raise the complexity unless NP = coNP.",

        "description": "Do runoff elections, using the same voting rule as the initial election but just on the winning candidates, increase or decrease the complexity of manipulation? Does allowing revoting in the runoff increase or decrease the complexity relative to just having a runoff without revoting? For both weighted and unweighted voting, we show that even for election systems with simple winner problems the complexity of manipulation, manipulation with runoffs, and manipulation with revoting runoffs are independent, in the abstract. On the other hand, for some important, well-known election systems we determine what holds for each of these cases. For no such systems do we find runoffs lowering complexity, and for some we find that runoffs raise complexity. Ours is the first paper to show that for natural, unweighted election systems, runoffs can increase the manipulation complexity.",

        "description": "Previous work on voter control, which refers to situations where a chair seeks to change the outcome of an election by deleting, adding, or partitioning voters, takes for granted that the chair knows all the voters\u2019 preferences and that all votes are cast simultaneously. However, elections are often held sequentially and the chair thus knows only the previously cast votes and not the future ones, yet needs to decide instantaneously which control action to take. We introduce a framework that models online voter control in sequential elections. We show that the related problems can be much harder than in the standard (non-online) case: For certain election systems, even with efficient winner problems, online control by deleting, adding, or partitioning voters is PSPACE-complete, even if there are only two candidates. In addition, we obtain completeness for coNP in the deleting/adding cases with a bounded deletion/addition limit, and for NP in the partition cases with only one candidate. Finally, we show that for plurality, online control by deleting or adding voters is in P, and for partitioning voters is coNP-hard.",

Since the latter is a far more natural goal for manipulators, that definitional focus may be misguided if these two complexities can differ. Our main result is that they probably do differ: If integer factoring is hard, then for election manipulation, election bribery, and some types of election control, there are election systems for which recognizing which instances can be successfully manipulated is in polynomial time but producing the successful manipulations cannot be done in polynomial time.",

It has recently been noted that many of these problems fall into polynomial time if the electorate is single-peaked (i.e., is polarized along some axis/issue). However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked. There are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely be nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of manipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked electorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems. We provide instances where even one maverick jumps the manipulative-action complexity up to NP-hardness, but we also provide many instances where a reasonable number of mavericks can be tolerated without increasing the manipulative-action complexity.",

In the Post case, we obtain a dichotomy result: Minimization is solvable in polynomial time or coNP-hard. This result also applies to Boolean circuits. For CNF formulas, we obtain new minimization algorithms for a large class of formulas, and give strong evidence that we have covered all polynomial-time cases.",

That work has led to many results on how algorithms can be used to find attacks on elections and how complexity-theoretic hardness results can be used as shields against attacks. However, all the work in this line has assumed that the attacker employs just a single type of attack. In this paper, we model and study the case in which the attacker launches a multipronged (ie, multimode) attack. We do so to more realistically capture the richness of real-life settings. For example, an attacker might simultaneously try to suppress some voters, attract new voters into the election, and introduce a spoiler candidate. Our model provides a unified framework for such varied attacks. By constructing polynomial-time multiprong attack algorithms we prove that for various election systems even such concerted, flexible attacks can be perfectly planned in deterministic polynomial time.",

And surely for just as long, people or more recently, electronic agents have been trying to affect the outcomes of those elections. Such attempts take many forms. often and naturally, actors may seek to change the structure of the election, for example, by attracting new voters, suppressing turnout, recruiting candidates, or setting election district boundaries. Sometimes voters may even be bribed to vote a certain way. And a voter may try to manipulate an election by casting an insincere vote that may yield a more favorable outcome than would the voter's sincere vote: Not all people who preferred Ralph Nader in the 2004 US presidential election actually voted for him.One might hope that by choosing a particularly wonderful election system, one can perfectly block such attacks. However, classic work from economics and political science proves that every reasonable election system sometimes gives voters an incentive to vote insincerely (see Duggan 17 and the references therein). Reasonable election systems cannot make manipulation impossible. However, they can make manipulation computationally infeasible."

We completely classify the complexity of modal satisfiability for every finite set of propositional operators, i.e., in contrast to previous work, we classify an infinite number of problems. We show that, depending on the set of propositional operators, modal satisfiability is PSPACE-complete, coNP-complete, or in P. We obtain this trichotomy not only for modal formulas, but also for their more succinct representation using modal circuits. We consider both the uni-modal and the multi-modal cases, and study the dual problem of validity as well.",

Recently, kings have proven useful in theoretical computer science, in particular in the study of the complexity of reachability problems and semifeasible sets. In this article, we study the complexity of recognizing kings. For each succinctly specified family of tournaments, the king problem is already known to belong to \u03a02p. We prove that the complexity of kingship problems is a rich enough vocabulary to pinpoint every nontrivial many-one degree in \u03a02p.

        "description": "We study the complexity of influencing elections through bribery: How computationally complex is it for an external actor to determine whether by paying certain voters to change their preferences a specified candidate can be made the elections winner? We study this problem for election systems as varied as scoring protocols and Dodgson voting, and in a variety of settings regarding homogeneous-vs.-nonhomogeneous electorate bribability, bounded-size-vs.-arbitrary-sized candidate sets, weighted-vs.-unweighted voters, and succinct-vs.-nonsuccinct input specification. We obtain both polynomial-time bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery, and indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely sensitive to the setting. For example, we find settings in which bribery is NP-complete but manipulation (by voters) is in P, and we find settings in which bribing weighted voters is NP-complete but bribing voters with individual bribe thresholds is in P. For the broad class of elections (including plurality, Borda, k-approval, and veto) known as scoring protocols, we prove a dichotomy result for bribery of weighted voters: We find a simple-to-evaluate condition that classifies every case as either NP-complete or in P.",

        "description": "Control of elections refers to attempts by an agent to, via such actions as addition/deletion/partition of candidates or voters, ensure that a given candidate wins [BTT92]. An election system in which such an agent's computational task is NP-hard is said to be resistant to the given type of control. The only election systems known to be resistant to all the standard control types are highly artificial election systems created by hybridization [HHR07]. In this paper, we prove that an election system developed by the 13th century mystic Ramon Llull and the well-studied Copeland election system are both resistant to all the standard types of (constructive) electoral control other than one variant of addition of candidates. This is the most comprehensive resistance to control yet achieved by any natural election system. In addition, we show that Llull and Copeland voting are very broadly resistant to bribery attacks, and we integrate the potential irrationality of voter preferences into many of our results."

        "description": "Control and bribery are settings in which an external agent seeks to influence the outcome of an election. Faliszewski et al.[FHHR07] proved that Llull voting (which is here denoted by Copeland^ 1) and a variant (here denoted by Copeland^ 0) of Copeland voting are computationally resistant to many, yet not all, types of constructive control and that they also provide broad resistance to bribery. We study a parameterized version of Copeland voting, denoted by Copeland^ alpha where the parameter alpha is a rational number between 0 and 1 that specifies how ties are valued in the pairwise comparisons of candidates in Copeland elections. We establish resistance or vulnerability results, in every previously studied control scenario, for Copeland^ alpha, for each rational alpha, 0< alpha< 1. In particular, we prove that Copeland^ 0.5, the system commonly referred to as``Copeland voting,''provides full resistance to constructive control. Among the systems with a polynomial-time winner problem, this is the first natural election system proven to have full resistance to constructive control. Results on bribery and fixed-parameter tractability of bounded-case control proven for Copeland^ 0 and Copeland^ 1 in [FHHR07] are extended to Copeland^ alpha for each rational alpha, 0< alpha< 1; we also give results in more flexible models such as microbribery and extended control."

We study this problem for election systems as varied as scoring protocols and Dodgson voting, and in a variety of settings regarding homogeneous-vs.-nonhomogeneous electorate bribability, bounded-size-vs.-arbitrary-sized candidate sets, weighted-vs.-unweighted voters, and succinct-vs.-nonsuccinct input specification. We obtain both polynomialtime bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery, and indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely sensitive to the setting. For example, we find settings in which bribery is NP-complete but manipulation (by voters) is in P, and we find settings in which bribing weighted voters is NP-complete but bribing voters with individual bribe thresholds is in P. For the broad class of elections (including plurality, Borda, k-approval, and veto) known as scoring protocols, we prove a dichotomy result for bribery of weighted voters: We find a simple-to-evaluate condition that classifies every case as either NP-complete or in P.",

These areas include artificial intelligence, database theory, distributed systems, program verification, and cryptography theory. Modal logic operators contain propositional logic operators, such as conjunction and negation, and operators that can have the following meanings:\" it is necessary that,\"\" after a program has terminated,\"\" an agent knows or believes that,\"\" it is always the case that,\" etc. Computer scientists have examined the difficulty of problems in modal logic, such as satisfiability. Satisfiability determines whether a formula in a given logic is satisfiable. The complexity of satisfiability in modal logic has a wide range. Depending on how a modal logic is restricted, the complexity can be anywhere from NP-complete to highly undecidable. This project gives an introduction to common variations of modal logic in computer science and their complexity results.",

We completely classify the complexity of modal satisfiability for every finite set of propositional operators, i.e., in contrast to previous work, we classify an infinite number of problems.

He defined an infinite number of propositional satisfiability problems, showed that all these problems are either in P or NP-complete, and gave a simple criterion to determine which of the two cases holds. This result is surprising in light of Ladner's theorem, which implies that there are an infinite number of complexity classes between P and NP-complete (under the assumption that P is not equal to NP). Schaefer also stated a dichotomy theorem for quantified generalized Boolean formulas, but this theorem was only recently proven by Creignou, Khanna, and Sudan, and independently by Dalmau: Determining truth of quantified Boolean formulas is either PSPACE-complete or in P. This paper looks at alternation-bounded quantified generalized Boolean formulas. In their unrestricted forms, these problems are the canonical problems complete for the levels of the polynomial hierarchy. In this paper, we prove dichotomy theorems for alternation-bounded quantified generalized Boolean formulas, by showing that these problems are either -complete or in P, and we give a simple criterion to determine which of the two cases holds. This is the first result that obtains dichotomy for an infinite number of classes at once.",

If so, which order yields the greater computational power? The answers to these questions have been learned-inasfar as they can be learned without resolving whether or not the polynomial hierarchy collapses-for both the polynomial hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy. In the polynomial hierarchy, query order never matters. In the boolean hierarchy, query order sometimes does not matter and, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, sometimes does matter. Furthermore, the study of query order has yielded dividends in seemingly unrelated areas, such as bottleneck computations and downward translation of equality. In this article, we present some of the central results on query order. The article is written in such a way as to encourage the reader to try his or her own hand at proving some of these results.

However, the problems his toolkit applies to most directly are not overly natural. During the past year, problems that previously were known only to be NP-hard or coNP-hard have been shown to be hard even for the class of sets solvable via parallel access to NP. Many of these problems are longstanding and extremely natural, such as the Minimum Equivalent Expression problem (which was the original motivation for creating the polynomial hierarchy), the problem of determining the winner in the election system introduced by Lewis Carroll in 1876, and the problem of determining on which inputs heuristic algorithms perform well. In the present article, we survey this recent progress in raising lower bounds."

In particular, positive Turing reduction to DP already yields all (and only) sets Turing reducibility to NP. Thus, positive Turing and Turing reducibility to DP yield the same class.

        "description": "During the past decade, nine papers have obtained increasingly strong consequences from the assumption that boolean or bounded-query hierarchies collapse. The final four papers of this nine-paper progression actually achieve downward collapse---that is, they show that high-level collapses induce collapses at (what before-the-fact seemed to be) lower complexity levels. For example, for each k \u2265 2 it. is now known that if one query to \u03c3pk is as powerful as two queries to \u03c3pk (i.e., P\u03a3[1] = P\u03a3[2]), then PH = \u03c3pk. This article surveys the history, the results, and the method---the so-called easy-hard technique---of the just-mentioned nine-paper progression:1. J. Kadin. The polynomial time hierarchy collapses if the boolean hierarchy collapses. SIAM Journal on Computing, 17(6):1263--1282, 1988. Erratum appears in the same journal. 20(2):404.2. K. Wagner.

They denote this problem by Sr and prove that for each rational r \u2a7e 1, Sr is coNP-hard. They also provide a PNP upper bound of Sr, leaving open the question of whether this gap between the upper and the lower bound of Sr can be closed. For the special case of r = 1, they show that S1 is even DP-hard, again leaving open the question of whether S1 can be shown to be complete for DP or some larger class such as PNP. In this note, we completely solve all the questions left open by Bodlaender et al. Our main result is that for each rational r \u2a7e 1, Sr is complete for P\u2225NP, the class of sets solvable via parallel access to NP.",

It follows that determining the winner in      Carroll's elections is not NP-complete unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.",

In particular, we completely determine the relative strengths of polynomial-time \u0192 (n)-to-reductions, and of polynomial-time k-to-k\u2032 reductions.",

Most papers in which truthtable reductions appear refer to the seminal paper of Ladner, Lynch and Selman for a definition. The definition of truth-table reductions given there however, pertains to only one of the possible incarnations of the notion. For larger resource bounds, this definition often coincides with other-often implicitly used-definitions of the notion. In this paper we focus our attention on resource bounds for which the various definitions probably donot pertain to the same notion. In particular, we show that coincidence of different notions implies coincidence of complexity classes likeNC 1,LOG, andP, which are widely believed to be different.",

In this paper we put this observation to work. We study the complexity of the satisfiability problem for nine modal languages which mirror different aspects of AVS description formalisms, including the ability to express re-entrancy, the ability to express generalisations, and the ability to express recursive constraints. Two main techniques are used: either Kripke models with desirable properties are constructed, or modalities are used to simulate fragments of Propositional Dynamic Logic. Further possibilities for the application of modal logic in computational linguistics are noted.",

We show that feature logics capable of both enforcing re-entrancy and stating linguistic generalisations will have undecidable satisfiability problems even when most Boolean expressivity has been discarded. We exhibit a decidable fragment, but the restrictions imposed to ensure decidability render it unfit for stand-alone use. The import of these results is discussed, and we conclude that there is a need for feature logics that are less homogeneous in their treatment of linguistic structure.",

In particular, he showed that provability in all modal logics between K and 84 is PSPACE-hard, and he constructed polynomial space bounded algorithms for deciding provability in K, T, and 84, which implies that the provability problems for these logics are PSPACE-complete. In this paper, we investigate to what extent these results go through for tense logics. Note that any lower bound for provability in a modal logic 8 carries over to the corresponding tense logic 8t. In particular, it follows that for any modal logic 8 between K and 84, the provability problem for the tense logic 8t is PSPACE-hard. However, it is by no means obvious that the upper bounds for modal logics carryover to the corresponding tense logics. Given two logics that have provability problems in PSPACE, it is in general not the case that provability for a combination\u00a0\u2026",

And surely for just as long, people\u2014or more recently, electronic agents\u2014have been trying to affect the outcomes of those elections. Such attempts take many forms. often and naturally, actors may seek to change the structure of the election, for example, by attracting new voters, suppressing turnout, recruiting candidates, or setting election district boundaries. Sometimes voters may even be bribed to vote a certain way. And a voter may try to manipulate an election by casting an insincere vote that may yield a more favorable outcome than would the voter\u2019s sincere vote: Not all people who preferred Ralph Nader in the 2004 US presidential election actually voted for him.One might hope that by choosing a particularly wonderful election system, one can perfectly block such attacks.
