Many cyber threats have been detected and emerged in the last few years. Among multiple threats, malware attacks are considered to be prominent due to the impact on users and systems. Considering the evolving trend of such cyber threats, traditional statistical and heuristic threat detection approaches have observed the need to be more effective and efficient. Machine learning (ML)-based cyber-threat detection has been actively researched and adopted across academia and industry to address the challenges of evolving cyber threats. However, ML-based neural network techniques though efficient, are considered black boxes due to the lack of sufficient information that can be used to deduce their functionality. On the\u00a0\u2026"

Existing benchmarks provide general evaluations but do not sufficiently address the practical and applied aspects of LLM performance in cybersecurity-specific tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the SECURE (Security Extraction, Understanding \\& Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs performance in realistic cybersecurity scenarios. SECURE includes six datasets focussed on the Industrial Control System sector to evaluate knowledge extraction, understanding, and reasoning based on industry-standard sources. Our study evaluates seven state-of-the-art models on these tasks, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity contexts, and offer recommendations for improving LLMs reliability as cyber advisory tools."

        "description": "Deep neural networks for classification are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations to input samples lead to incorrect predictions. This susceptibility, combined with the black-box nature of such networks, limits their adoption in critical applications like autonomous driving. Feature-attribution-based explanation methods provide relevance of input features for model predictions on input samples, thus explaining model decisions. However, we observe that both model predictions and feature attributions for input samples are sensitive to noise. We develop a practical method for this characteristic of model prediction and feature attribution to detect adversarial samples. Our method, PASA, requires the computation of two test statistics using model prediction and feature attribution and can reliably detect adversarial samples using thresholds learned from benign samples. We validate our lightweight approach by evaluating the performance of PASA on varying strengths of FGSM, PGD, BIM, and CW attacks on multiple image and non-image datasets. On average, we outperform state-of-the-art statistical unsupervised adversarial detectors on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet by 14\\% and 35\\% ROC-AUC scores, respectively. Moreover, our approach demonstrates competitive performance even when an adversary is aware of the defense mechanism."

A majority of IT organizations have workloads spread across different cloud service providers, growing their multi-cloud environments. When an organization grows their multi-cloud environment, the threat vectors and vulnerabilities for their cloud systems and services grow as well. The increase in the number of attack vectors creates a challenge of how to prioritize mitigations and countermeasures to best defend a multi-cloud environment against attacks. Utilizing multiple industry standard risk analysis tools, we conducted an analysis of multi-cloud threat vectors enabling calculation and prioritization for the identified mitigations and countermeasures. The prioritizations from the analysis showed that authentication and architecture are the highest risk areas of threat vectors. Armed with this data, IT managers are able to more appropriately budget cybersecurity expenditure to implement the most impactful mitigations and countermeasures."

While these models are known for their high accuracy, they behave as black boxes in which identifying important features and factors that led to a classification or a prediction is difficult. This can lead to uncertainty and distrust, especially when an incorrect prediction results in severe consequences. Thus, explanation methods aim to provide insights into the inner working of deep learning models. However, most explanation methods provide inconsistent explanations, have low fidelity, and are susceptible to adversarial manipulation, which can reduce model trustworthiness.

Therefore, there is a need for a holistic security and vulnerability assessment and defense strategy that applies to multi-cloud platforms. We perform a risk and vulnerability analysis to identify attack vectors from software, hardware, and the network, as well as interoperability security issues in multi-cloud environments. Applying the STRIDE and DREAD threat modeling methods, we present an analysis of the ecosystem across six attack vectors: cloud architecture, APIs, authentication, automation, management differences, and cybersecurity legislation.

Machine learning (ML) models form the basis of many such AI systems. These models are notorious for acting like black boxes, transforming inputs into solutions with great accuracy, but no explanations support their decisions. Explanations are needed to communicate model performance, make decisions transparent, and establish trust in the models with stakeholders. Explanations can also indicate when humans must take control, for instance, when the ML model makes low confidence decisions or offers multiple or ambiguous alternatives. Explanations also provide evidence for post-incident forensic analysis. Research on explainable ML to security problems is limited, and more so concerning CAVs. This paper surfaces a critical yet under-researched sensor data \\textit{uncertainty} problem for training ML attack detection models, especially in highly mobile and risk-averse platforms such as autonomous vehicles. We present a model that explains \\textit{certainty} and \\textit{uncertainty} in sensor input -- a missing characteristic in data collection. We hypothesize that model explanation is inaccurate for a given system without explainable input data quality. We estimate \\textit{uncertainty} and mass functions for features in radar sensor data and incorporate them into the training model through experimental evaluation. The mass function allows the classifier to categorize all spoofed inputs accurately with an incorrect class label.",

Numerous defense approaches have been proposed to either detect such adversarial attacks or improve model robustness. These approaches have resulted in a multitude of attack and defense techniques and the emergence of a field known as `adversarial machine learning.' In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive review of adversarial machine learning in the context of Android malware classifiers. Android is the most widely used operating system globally and is an easy target for malicious agents.

Food computing has attracted great interest from various fields. Representing food as vectors can capture hidden information gleaned from massive datasets and help further studies on food. As an important task of food computing, food recommendation can be a means to help people find food they might love, and also to help them eat more healthily. Acting as a special case of food recommendation, food substitution is an open task to explore potential food alternatives. Structured knowledge furnishes an in-depth understanding of the world.

Moreover, while many personal health applications cater to general health and well-being, there remains a significant opportunity to increase the clinical relevance of the insights being generated. This chapter describes the motivation for, and illustrative applications of, semantic technologies for enabling clinically relevant personal health applications. We present two use cases that demonstrate how semantic web technologies, in combination with machine learning and data mining methods, can be used to provide personalized insights to support behaviors that are consistent with nutritional guidelines for people with diabetes.",

Thus, the emergent danger comes from the effectiveness and the propensity of such systems to replicate, reinforce, or amplify harmful existing discriminatory acts. Algorithmic bias exposes a deeply entrenched encoding of a range of unwanted biases that can have profound real-world effects that manifest in domains from employment, to housing, to healthcare. The last decade of research and examples on these effects further underscores the need to examine any claim of a value-neutral technology. This work examines the intersection of algorithmic bias in consumer mobile health technologies (mHealth). We include mHealth, a term used to describe mobile technology and associated sensors to provide healthcare solutions through patient journeys. We also include mental and behavioral health (mental and physiological) as part of our study. Furthermore, we explore to what extent current mechanisms - legal, technical, and or normative - help mitigate potential risks associated with unwanted bias in intelligent systems that make up the mHealth domain. We provide additional guidance on the role and responsibilities technologists and policymakers have to ensure that such systems empower patients equitably.",

Automating the process of communicating contextual and trustworthy explanations of cyberattacks should also handle various attack models, although it adds to the existing challenge. However, a scientific approach to addressing explanations can generate a system that can offer the desired explanations under most use cases.

Ground truth is established using DANTE and used as baseline for identifying anomalous behavior. For this, system logs are modeled as a natural language sequence and patterns are extracted from these sequences.

        "description": "Modern networked systems are constantly under threat from systemic attacks. There has been a massive upsurge in the number of devices connected to a network as well as the associated traffic volume. This has intensified the need to better understand all possible attack vectors during system design and implementation. Further, it has increased the need to mine large data sets, analyzing which has become a daunting task. It is critical to scale monitoring infrastructures to match this need, but a difficult goal for the small and medium organization. Hence, there is a need to propose novel approaches that address the big data problem in security. Information Centrality (IC) labels network nodes with better vantage points for detecting network-based anomalies as central nodes and uses them for detecting a category of attacks called systemic attacks. The main idea is that since these central nodes already see a lot of information flowing through the network, they are in a good position to detect anomalies before other nodes. This research first dives into the importance of using graphs in understanding the topology and information flow. We then introduce the usage of information centrality, a centrality-based index, to reduce data collection in existing communication networks. Using IC-identified central nodes can accelerate outlier detection when armed with a suitable anomaly detection technique. We also come up with a more efficient way to compute Information centrality for large networks. Finally, we demonstrate that central nodes detect anomalous behavior much faster than other non-central nodes, given the anomalous behavior is systemic in\u00a0\u2026",

From a security perspective, we are noticing that the user behavior is bordering high on anxiety, which is further increasing the quantum measure of data collection before rightfully understanding the legitimate need behind it. Mirroring this is the rapid inclusion of security experts as part of the core team that designs and builds platforms and networks. This increases the awareness of potential attack vectors that may impact these systems. However, data analytics (not necessarily security-related) has further\u00a0\u2026",

Jigsaw is pursuing several promising projects that aim to ensure freedom of speech, especially for independent journalists, analyze acts of extremism in order to prevent more of them, and investigate financial records to expose government corruption. Finally, financial support is a key ingredient in all such efforts.

        "description": "WhatsApp messenger is arguably the most popular mobile app available on all smart-phones. Over one billion people worldwide for free messaging, calling, and media sharing use it. In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a default endto-end encrypted service. This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls, videos, audios, and any otherform of information exchanged cannot be read by any unauthorized entity since WhatsApp version 2.16. 2 (released April 2016). In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp messaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on its privacy preservation mechanisms. We report that the Signal Protocol, which forms the basis of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption, does offer protection against forward secrecy, and MITM to a large extent. Finally, we argue that simply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy. The metadata can reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their patterns, and personal information. This paper elaborates on the security architecture of WhatsApp and performs an analysis on the various protocols used. This enlightens us on the status quo of the app security and what further measures can be used to fill existing gaps without compromising the usability. We start by describing the following (i) important concepts that need to be understood to properly understand security,(ii) the security architecture,(iii) security evaluation,(iv) followed by a summary of our work. Some of the important concepts that we cover in this paper before evaluating the architecture are-end-to-end encryption (E2EE), signal protocol, and curve25519. The\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "In the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are exposed to various kinds of attacks when connected to the Internet. An attack detection mechanism that understands the limitations of these severely resource-constrained devices is necessary. This is important since current approaches are either customized for wireless networks or for the conventional Internet with heavy data transmission. Also, the detection mechanism need not always be as sophisticated. Simply signaling that an attack is taking place may be enough in some situations, for example in NIDS using anomaly detection. In graph networks, central nodes are the nodes that bear the most influence in the network. The purpose of this research is to explore experimentally the relationship between the behavior of central nodes and anomaly detection when an attack spreads through a network. As a result, we propose a novel anomaly detection approach using this unique methodology which has been unexplored so far in communication networks. Also, in the experiment, we identify presence of an attack originating and propagating throughout a network of IoT using our methodology.",

Several security algorithms that have been proposed, aim at achieving inter-network security but fail to address mobility and scalability requirements of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel security scheme that addresses the limitations in the existing security protocols for IHWS networks and prove its efficiency through extensive simulations.",

Any of the following networks: cellular networks, WLANs, and ad hoc and sensor networks can constitute an IHWN network. The user is free to roam within networks seamlessly based on his needs and network availability. However, the security concerns associated with the IHWN count for some of the challenges involved in its implementation. These concerns combined with the different security requirements of various constituent wireless networks may have made security a serious issue. Seamless transfer of user\u2019s credentials is a major requirement when considering security during vertical handoff between two different types of networks. A security scheme that can fit all types of networks is difficult to propose. However, a reasonable architecture that keeps both security and user convenience into consideration can be designed. The existing security schemes fail to address mobility and scalability requirements. Considering the importance of these aspects in securing a global network, we propose a novel security scheme that uses two different security algorithms depending on the number of vertical handoffs made by the mobile node after the first authentication in the home network. It makes use of existing network elements, such as RADIUS and Diameter protocols and supports scalability, mobility, and secure key exchange. We also introduce a time factor which is pre-set between the home network and foreign network. It delegates the task of authorizing subsequent requests from mobile node to connect\u00a0\u2026"
