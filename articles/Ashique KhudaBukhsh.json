Such approaches are transitioning towards leveraging social media conversations to analyze the needs of communities and the assets already present within them. However, manual analysis of exponentially increasing social media conversations is challenging. There is a gap in the present literature in computationally analyzing how community members discuss the strengths and needs of the community. To address this gap, we introduce the task of identifying, extracting, and categorizing community needs and assets from conversational data using sophisticated natural language processing methods. To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset about community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit, annotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an utterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a popular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our model outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61% respectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations about needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about assets focus on location and entities."

First, via a comprehensive investigation of more than 40 Twitter datasets, we identify that many of these datasets suffer from severe retrieval loss. Second, we demonstrate that the retrieval loss across labels is often imbalanced with inappropriate labels (e.g., misinformation, hate speech) suffering from more retrieval loss. Finally, we demonstrate that imbalanced retrieval loss may impact machine learning models differently than balanced retrieval loss."

Since this is usually an unpleasant outcome of a marital union, each party may have reasons to call the decision to quit which is generally documented in detail in the court proceedings. Via a substantial corpus of 17,306 court proceedings, this paper investigates gender inequality through the lens of divorce court proceedings. While emerging data sources (e.g., public court records) on sensitive societal issues hold promise in aiding social science research, biases present in cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) methods may interfere with or affect such studies. We thus require a thorough analysis of potential gaps and limitations present in extant NLP resources. In this paper, on the methodological side, we demonstrate that existing NLP resources required several non-trivial modifications to quantify societal inequalities. On the substantive side, we find that while a large number of court cases perhaps suggest changing norms in India where women are increasingly challenging patriarchy, AI-powered analyses of these court proceedings indicate striking gender inequality with women often subjected to domestic violence.",

We present an ensemble active learning pipeline to train a stance classifier. Our novelty lies in the involvement of Iranian women in an active role as annotators in building this AI system. Our annotators not only provide labels, but they also suggest valuable keywords for more meaningful corpus creation as well as provide short example documents for a guided sampling step. Our analyses indicate that Mahsa Amini's death triggered polarized Persian language discourse where both fractions of negative and positive tweets toward gender equality increased. The increase in positive tweets was slightly greater than the increase in negative tweets. We also observe that with respect to account creation time, between the state-aligned Twitter accounts and pro-protest Twitter accounts, pro-protest accounts are more similar to baseline Persian Twitter activity.",

This study investigates the prevalence of social biases in children's videos on the top 100 YouTube Kids (YTK) channels having over 80,000 videos. Using video transcripts and picture frames, we examine gender and occupational stereotypes. Results from the Word Embedding Association Test and similar bias assessments reveal clear gender biases in many occupations, STEM-related fields, etc. We also find that video frames display more significant gender biases than video transcripts, suggesting that women are underrepresented in occupational discussions. The study's findings are important for content creators, video platform providers, and policymakers, highlighting a need for more vigilance in creating and recommending kids' content. We further propose a multi-modal bias metric that combines language and visual biases."

As a result, these classifiers' strong performance observed on the test set may not translate into real-world settings. In the context of COVID-19 misinformation detection, we conduct an in-the-wild audit of multiple datasets and demonstrate that models trained with several prominently cited recent datasets are vulnerable to anticontent when evaluated in the wild.

Our polarization and question answering results indicated that left-leaning media tended to represent refugees as child victims, welcome in the US, and right-leaning media cast refugees as Islamic terrorists. We noted similar results with our sentiment and offensive speech scores over time, which detail possibly unfavorable representations of refugees in right-leaning media. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other. Based on our results, we provide several recommendations. Stakeholders may utilize our findings to intervene around refugee representations, and design communications campaigns that improve the way society sees refugees and possibly aid refugee outcomes.",

        "description": "YouTube Kids (YTK) is one of the most popular kids' applications used by millions of kids daily. However, various studies have highlighted concerns about the videos on the platform, like the over-presence of entertaining and commercial content. YouTube recently proposed high-quality guidelines that include `promoting learning' and proposed to use it in ranking channels. However, the concept of learning is multi-faceted, and it can be difficult to define and measure in the context of online videos. This research focuses on learning in terms of what's taught in schools and proposes a way to measure the academic quality of children's videos. Using a new dataset of questions and answers from children's videos, we first show that a Reading Comprehension (RC) model can estimate academic learning. Then, using a large dataset of middle school textbook questions on diverse topics, we quantify the academic quality of top channels as the number of children's textbook questions that an RC model can correctly answer. By analyzing over 80,000 videos posted on the top 100 channels, we present the first thorough analysis of the academic quality of channels on YTK."

We use word embeddings to provide two-dimensional visualizations of the semantic changes around vaping for news and for social media. We detail that news media framing of vaping shifted over time in line with emergent regulatory trends, such as; flavored vaping bans, with little discussion around vaping as a smoking cessation tool. We found that social media discussions were far more varied, with transitions toward vaping both as a public health harm and as a smoking cessation tool. Our cloze test, dynamic topic models, and question answering showed similar patterns, where social media, but not news media, characterizes vaping as combustible cigarette\u00a0\u2026",

In this work, we focus on the high-resource and low-resource language pair  (English, and Romanized Hindi) and present a cross-lingual sampling method that takes example documents in English, and retrieves similar content written in Romanized Hindi, the most popular form of Hindi observed in social media.

Our analyses reveal that several of these lexicons barely make any distinction between pejorative and non-pejorative queer-related words. We express concern that such unfettered usage of non-pejorative queer-related words may impact queer presence in mainstream discourse. Our analyses further reveal that the lexicons have poor overlap in queer-related words.

Consequently, YouTube Kids' content should receive an additional level of scrutiny to ensure children's safety. While research on detecting offensive or inappropriate content for kids is gaining momentum, little or no current work exists that investigates to what extent AI applications can (accidentally) introduce content that is inappropriate for kids. In this paper, we present a novel (and troubling) finding that well-known automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems may produce text content highly inappropriate for kids while transcribing YouTube Kids' videos. We dub this phenomenon as inappropriate content hallucination. Our analyses suggest that such hallucinations are far from occasional, and the ASR systems often produce them with high confidence. We release a first-of-its-kind data set of audios for which the existing state-of-the-art ASR systems hallucinate inappropriate content for kids.

From this large, unlabeled pool of interruptions, we release an annotated dataset consisting of 2,000 dialogues with fine-grained interruption labels. We use this dataset to train an interruption classifier and predict the interruption type of a given dialogue. Our results reveal that male speakers (in our collected samples) tend to talk more than female speakers, while female speakers interrupt more. Moreover, people tend to use less intrusive interruptions when talking to others sharing the same political belief.

We cast the problem of aggregate stance mining as a natural language inference task and construct an active learning pipeline for robust textual entailment prediction. Via a substantial corpus of 34,710 news transcripts, our analyses reveal that the partisan divide in viewership of these three outlets reflects on the network\u2019s news coverage of these momentous events. In addition, we release a sentence-level, domain-specific text entailment data set on policing consisting of 2,276 annotated instances.",

Significant strides have been made recently in low-resource NLP research. Powerful unsupervised methods, large-scale multilingual language models, and other innovations have enabled rapid progress in a variety of areas for low-resource NLP. However, real world text analyses are rarely standalone tasks and practitioners often combine several methods. This book describes important advances in low-resource NLP and contains real world examples explaining how to assemble them to perform robust, sophisticated text analyses.

Amidst a wave of infections in India that resulted in a systemic breakdown of healthcare infrastructure, a social welfare organization based in Pakistan offered to procure medical-grade oxygen to assist India -- a nation which was involved in four wars with Pakistan in the past few decades. In this paper, we focus on Pakistani Twitter users' response to the ongoing healthcare crisis in India. While #IndiaNeedsOxygen and #PakistanStandsWithIndia featured among the top-trending hashtags in Pakistan, divisive hashtags such as #EndiaSaySorryToKashmir simultaneously started trending. Against the backdrop of a contentious history including four wars, divisive content of this nature, especially when a country is facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis, fuels further deterioration of relations. In this paper, we define a new task of detecting \\emph{supportive} content and demonstrate that existing \\emph{NLP for social impact} tools can be effectively harnessed for such tasks within a quick turnaround time. We also release the first publicly available data set at the intersection of geopolitical relations and a raging pandemic in the context of India and Pakistan.",

While the entertainment impact in terms of lives that Bollywood can potentially touch is mammoth, no NLP study on social biases in Bollywood content exists. We thus seek to understand social biases in a developing country through the lens of popular movies. Our argument is simple--popular movie content reflects social norms and beliefs in some form or shape. We present our preliminary findings on a longitudinal corpus of English subtitles of popular Bollywood movies focusing on (1) social bias toward a fair skin color (2) gender biases, and (3) gender representation. We contrast our findings with a similar corpus of Hollywood movies. Surprisingly, we observe that much of the biases we report in our preliminary experiments on the Bollywood corpus, also gets reflected in the Hollywood corpus.",

With a novel proposition that two sub-communities are speaking in two different\" languages\", we demonstrate that modern machine translation methods can provide a simple yet powerful and interpretable framework to understand the differences between two (or more) large-scale social media discussion data sets at the granularity of words.

However, much of it focused on the US political system or its culturally controversial topics. In this work, we explore polarization on Twitter in a different context, namely the protest that paralyzed several countries in the South American region in 2019. By leveraging users' endorsement of politicians' tweets and hashtag campaigns with defined stances towards the protest (for or against), we construct a weakly labeled stance dataset with millions of users. We explore polarization in two related dimensions: language and news consumption patterns. In terms of linguistic polarization, we apply recent insights that leveraged machine translation methods, showing that the two communities speak consistently \"different\" languages, mainly along ideological lines (e.g., fascist translates to communist). Our results indicate that this recently-proposed methodology is also informative in different languages and contexts than originally applied. In terms of news consumption patterns, we cluster news agencies based on homogeneity of their user bases and quantify the observed polarization in its consumption. We find empirical evidence of the \"filter bubble\" phenomenon during the event, as we not only show that the user bases are homogeneous in terms of stance, but the probability that a user transitions from media of different clusters is low.",

In fast-spreading pandemic situations such as the current COVID-19 situation, information processing objectives might be heavily tilted towards under-served languages in densely populated regions. We release our models to facilitate downstream analyses in these low-resource languages. Experiments across multiple social media corpora demonstrate the model\u2019s robustness and provide several interesting insights on Indian language usage patterns on social media.

In this work, we utilize a single Skip-gram model trained on a multilingual corpus yielding polyglot word embeddings, and present a novel finding that a surprisingly simple constrained nearest-neighbor sampling technique in this embedding space can retrieve bilingual lexicons, even in harsh social media data sets predominantly written in English and Romanized Hindi and often exhibiting code switching. Our method does not require monolingual corpora, seed lexicons, or any other such resources. Additionally, across three European language pairs, we observe that polyglot word embeddings indeed learn a rich semantic representation of words and substantial bilingual lexicons can be retrieved using our constrained nearest neighbor sampling. We investigate potential reasons and downstream applications in settings spanning both clean texts and noisy social media data sets, and in both resource-rich and under-resourced language pairs.",

Such omissions are common and convenient due to the sheer mismatch between linguistic resources offered in a world language and its low-resource counterpart. However, the path to analyze English content generated in linguistically diverse regions, such as the Indian subcontinent, is not straight-forward either. Social science/AI for social good research focusing on Indian sub-continental issues faces two major Natural Language Processing (NLP) challenges:(1) how to extract a (reasonably clean) monolingual English corpus?(2) How to extend resources and analyses to its low-resource counterpart? In this paper 1, we share NLP methods, lessons learnt from our multiple projects, and outline future focus areas that could be useful in tackling these two challenges. The discussed results are critical to two important domains:(1) detecting peace-seeking, hostility-diffusing hope speech in the context of the 2019 India-Pakistan conflict (2) detecting user generated web-content encouraging COVID-19 health compliance.",

        "description": "A group of agents are said to collude if they share information or make joint decisions in a manner contrary to explicit or implicit social rules that results in an unfair advantage over non-colluding agents or other interested parties. For instance, collusion manifests as sharing answers in exams, as colluding bidders in auctions, or as colluding participants (eg, Turkers) in crowd sourcing. This paper studies the latter, where the goal of the colluding participants is to\" earn\" money without doing the actual work, for instance by copying product ratings of another colluding participant, adding limited noise as attempted obfuscation. Such collusion not only yields fewer independent ratings, but may also introduce strong biases in aggregate results if undetected. Our proposed unsupervised collusion detection algorithm identifies colluding groups in crowd sourcing with fairly high accuracy both in synthetic and real data, and results in significant bias reduction, such as minimizing shifts from the true mean in rating tasks and recovering the true variance among raters.",

SATenstein-LScan be configured to instantiate a broad range of existing high-performance SLS-based SAT solvers, and also billions of novel algorithms. SATenstein-LSis built on top of UBCSAT [Tompkins and Hoos, 2004] framework and it is highly recommended to go through the quick start guide http://www. satlib. org/ubcsat/quickstart. html of UBCSAT to gain more familiarity with SATenstein-LS."

There are several compelling reasons like existence of pure strategy nash equilibrium, dominance solvability, identical bounds on joint strategy space etc. that make them a strong candidate for game theoretic modeling of economics. Supermodular games give a sound framework for analysis as it is based on a rich mathematical foundation of lattice theory and comparative statics. Supermodular games are also important for mechanism designers as it is observed that supermodularity has a strong connection with convergence to the nash equilibrium.",
