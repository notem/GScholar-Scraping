An Oblivious Pseudo Random Function (OPRF) is used, with operations using OPRFs occur over encrypted data, thus Data Owners learn only the primary object from Data Seeker and nothing else about the remainder of Data Owners' data. Similarly, Data Seeker learns a list of associated secondary objects and nothing else about Data Owners' data. The extent of sharing can be limited using a predefined threshold depending how much private information Data Owner is willing to share or Data Seeker is willing to pay."

By opportunistically caching content within the network, CCN appears to be well-suited for a large-scale content distribution and for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry applications that dominate today's Internet. To provide content authentication, CCN dictates that each content object must be digitally signed by its respective producer. All entities (consumers and routers) must, in principle, verify the content signature before processing it. However, in practice, this poses two challenges for routers: (1) overhead due to signature verification, key retrieval, and potential certificate chain traversal; and (2) lack of trust context, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to\u00a0\u2026",

During opera tion, the system generates, by a content-consuming device, a first key based on a first consumer-share key and a previously received producer-share key. The system con structs a first interest packet that includes the first consumer share key and a nonce token which is used as a pre-image of a previously generated first nonce, wherein the first interest has a name that includes a first prefix, and wherein the first nonce is used to establish a session between the content consuming device and a content-producing device. In response to the nonce token being verified by the content producing device, the system receives a first content-object packet with a payload that includes a first resumption\u00a0\u2026",

The centerpiece of ICN is named and addressable content, rather than hosts or interfaces. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a prominent ICN instance that shares the fundamental architectural design with its equally popular academic sibling Named- Data Networking (NDN). CCN eschews source addresses and creates one-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an interest). As an interest is forwarded it creates state in intervening routers and the requested content back is delivered over the reverse path using that state. Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms of efficiency and resilience to certain types of attacks, this has not been decisively proven via realistic experiments. Since keeping per-interest state complicates router\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "Content-centric networking (CCN) is a network architecture for transferring named data from producers to consumers upon request. This shifts security from that of a connection or channel to the content itself. There remains, however, many critical uses for the traditional client-server communication model with secure sessions. For instance, in many CCN applications, producers need a way to transfer key material or secret information to consumers. Not only does caching this content fail to serve multiple consumers, encrypting it under long-term, static keys does not afford them any forward secrecy. Consequently, there is a real and present need for a CCN-friendly protocol whose security properties meet or exceed similar transport security protocols in IP networks. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the CCNx Key Exchange Protocol - CCNxKE - the first protocol design for bootstrapping\u00a0\u2026",

We require that the participants do not discover each other's data, and the service provider remains oblivious to each participant's individual contribution. Furthermore, the final result is to be published in a differentially private manner, i.e., the result should not reveal the contribution of any single participant to a (possibly external) adversary who knows the contributions of all other participants. In other words, we require a secure multiparty computation protocol that also incorporates a differentially private mechanism. Previous solutions have resorted to caveats such as postulating a trusted dealer to distribute keys to the participants, or introducing additional entities to withhold the decryption key from the aggregator, or relaxing the star topology by allowing\u00a0\u2026",

ICN offers data-centric inter-networking that is radically different from today's host-based IP networks. Security and privacy features on today's Internet were originally not present and have been incrementally retrofitted over the last 35 years. As such, these issues have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures towards real-world deployment. Thus, while ICN-based architectures (e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques. This report documents the highlights and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251 on ``Information-centric Networking and Security.''

The process is aborted in case of a mismatch. DERT extracts and displays user-verifiable data. It then enters a countdown stage that lasts for a predetermined duration. A user observes the transaction information and, if the transaction amount and other details are deemed correct, presses an accept button provided on the DERT before the timer runs out. DERT signs the time-stamped transaction statement and sends it to the reader. This signed statement is then sent to the payment gateway and eventually to the financial institution that issued the payment DERT.",

The verifier logic is expressed in Prolog to show its simplicity (abstracting away, e.g., procedural certification chain verification steps) and to highlight subtle errors that can occur in the use and enforcement of trust models. The details of an implementation of our trust engine in the CCNx network stack are presented to demonstrate its viability and general modularity.

ICN offers a data-centric means of inter-networking that is radically different from today's host-based IP networks. Security and privacy issues in ICN have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures and nears real-world deployment. As is well known, in today's Internet, security and privacy features were originally not present and had to be incrementally and individually retrofitted (with varying success) over the last 35 years. In contrast, since ICN-based architectures (eg, NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques. This report documents the program and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251\" Information-centric Networking and Security.\" The goal was to bring together researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based architectures. Attendees represented diverse areas of expertise, including: networking, security, privacy, software engineering, and formal methods. Through presentations and focused working groups, attendees identified and discussed issues relevant to security and privacy, and charted paths for their mitigation.",

        "description": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a recent paradigm that claims to mitigate some limitations of the current IP-based Internet architecture. The centerpiece of ICN is named and addressable content, rather than hosts or interfaces. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a prominent ICN instance that shares the fundamental architectural design with its equally popular academic sibling Named-Data Networking (NDN). CCN eschews source addresses and creates one-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an interest). As an interest is forwarded it creates state in intervening routers and the requested content back is delivered over the reverse path using that state. Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms of efficiency, and resilience to certain types of attacks, this has not been decisively proven via realistic experiments. Since keeping per-interest state complicates router operations and makes the infrastructure susceptible to router state exhaustion attacks (e.g., there is currently no effective defense against interest flooding attacks), the value of the stateful forwarding plane in CCN should be re-examined. In this paper, we explore supposed benefits and various problems of the stateful forwarding plane. We then argue that its benefits are uncertain at best and it should not be a mandatory CCN feature. To this end, we propose a new stateless architecture for CCN that provides nearly all functionality of the stateful design without its headaches. We analyze performance and resource requirements of the proposed architecture, via experiments.",

The privacy constraints are that the participants do not discover each other's data, and the aggregator obtains the final results while remaining oblivious to each participant's individual contribution to the aggregate. In achieving these goals, previous approaches have either assumed a trusted dealer that distributes keys to the participants and the aggregator, or introduced additional parties that withhold the decryption key from the aggregator, or applied secret sharing with either pairwise communication amongst the participants or O(N2) ciphertext overhead at the aggregator. In contrast, we describe a protocol based on Shamir secret sharing and homomorphic encryption without assuming any additional parties\u00a0\u2026",

Real-world data often contains inconsistencies, conflicts and errors. Such dirty data increases processing costs and has a negative impact on analytics. Assessing the quality of a dataset is especially important when a party is considering acquisition of data held by an untrusted entity. In this scenario, it is necessary to consider privacy risks of the stakeholders. This paper examines challenges in privacy-preserving data quality assessment. A two-party scenario is considered, consisting of a client that wishes to test data quality and a server that holds the dataset. Privacy-preserving protocols are presented for testing important data quality metrics: completeness, consistency, uniqueness, timeliness and validity.

User privacy is protected by performing all targeting operations on the end-user's device. The protocol is based on a fuzzy commitment primitive that is realized using error correcting codes. The central idea is that a user is able to extract the coupon if her behavioral profile approximately matches the vendor's target profile. Unless the coupon is redeemed, the vendor discovers no information about the user's behavioral profile. The error correction coding framework enforces a natural tradeoff between the privacy of the vendor and the specificity of targeting. In other words, if the vendor wants to target a\u00a0\u2026",

In particular, Content-Oriented Networking (CON) has emerged as a promising next-generation Internet architecture: it sets to decouple content from hosts, at the network layer, by naming data rather than hosts. CON comes with a potential for a wide range of benefits, including reduced congestion and improved delivery speed by means of content caching, simpler configuration of network devices, and security at the data level. However, it remains an interesting open question whether or not, and to what extent, this emerging networking paradigm bears new privacy challenges.

In a newly proposed future Internet architecture, Named Data Networking (NDN), end users request desired data by sending Interest packets, and the network delivers Data packets upon request only, effectively eliminating many existing DDoS attacks. However, an NDN network can be subject to a new type of DDoS attack, namely Interest packet flooding. In this paper we investigate effective solutions to mitigate Interest flooding. We show that NDN's inherent properties of storing per packet state on each router and maintaining flow balance (i.e., one Interest packet retrieves at most one Data packet) provides the basis for effective DDoS mitigation algorithms.

OVERVIEW To make the testbed key deployment happen in a timely fashion, we start with a simple certification chain trust model, with the root key of the NDN testbed as a common well known trust anchor. There is a root key for the NDN testbed, which signs the keys for each site, which in turn sign keys of the users at each site. Users\u2019 keys can be used to further sign their devices and specific applications (Fig. 1). This simple design allows one to follow the trust chain to verify the legitimacy of a key, a capability much needed to meet the need for a number of usages including NDN routing and auto configuration. This document specifically focuses on getting keys published on the testbed ASAP, as a preliminary step towards understanding general trust models.",

This thin waist enabled the Internet\u2019s explosive growth by allowing both lower and upper layer technologies to innovate independently. However, IP was designed to create a communication network, where packets named only communication endpoints. Sustained growth in e-commerce, digital media, social networking, and smartphone applications has led to dominant use of the Internet as a distribution network. Distribution networks are fundamentally more general than communication networks, and solving distribution problems via a point-to-point communication protocol is complex and error-prone.The NDN project proposes an evolution of the IP architecture that generalizes the role of this thin waist, such that packets can name objects other than communication endpoints. The name in an NDN packet can be anything\u2013an endpoint, a data chunk in a movie or a book, a command to turn on some lights, etc. This conceptually simple change allows NDN networks to use almost all of the Internet\u2019s well-tested engineering properties to solve not only end-to-end communication problems but also content distribution and control problems. Based on three decades of experience with the strengths and limitations of the current Internet architecture, the design also builds in fundamental security primitives (via signatures on all named data) and self-regulation of network traffic (via flow balance between Interest and Data packets).

However, PiCoDa makes two more guarantees: it verifies a user\u2019s eligibility for a coupon, and it protects the vendor\u2019s privacy by not revealing the targeting strategy. To accommodate the constraints of different targeting strategies, PiCoDa provides two targeting protocols that tradeoff user privacy and vendor privacy in different ways. We show how both designs meet requirements for user privacy, vendor protection, and robustness. In addition, we present simulation results of the protocols using realistic parameters to further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of PiCoDa.",

Named Data Networking (NDN) is a large collaborative research effort that exemplifies the content-centric approach to networking. NDN has some innate privacy-friendly features, such as lack of source and destination addresses on packets. However, as discussed in this paper, NDN architecture prompts some privacy concerns mainly stemming from the semantic richness of names. We examine privacy-relevant characteristics of NDN and present an initial attempt to achieve communication privacy. Specifically, we design an NDN add-on tool, called ANDaNA, that borrows a number of features from Tor.

We obtain that understanding through development and experimental deployment of pilot applications. This investigation enables us to identify a set of general principles and guidelines for naming in NDN networks, and to translate these into naming conventions implemented in system libraries. Library implementation operationalizes what we have learned in a form that supports consistent reuse, to simplify future application development and accelerate progress.The opaqueness of names to the network and their significance of application concerns enables the design and development of the NDN architecture to proceed in parallel with our research into name structure, name discovery and namespace\u00a0\u2026",

Chapter 1 briefly reviews the NDN architectural model. Chapter 2 gives an overview of our research plan, describes the milestones reached through our second year\u2019s effort. Chapter 3 gives a detailed description of the activities and findings in each of the project\u2019s research areas. The heart of the Internet architecture is a simple, universal network layer (IP) which implements all the functionality necessary for global interconnectivity. This \u201cthin waist\u201d was the key enabler of the Internet\u2019s explosive growth but one of its design choices is the root cause of today\u2019s Internet problems. The Internet was designed as a communication network so the only entities that could be named in its packets were communication endpoints. Recent growth in e-commerce, digital media, social networking, and smartphone applications has resulted in the Internet primarily being used as a distribution network. Distribution networks are fundamentally more general than communication networks and solving distribution problems with a communications network is complex and error prone. NDN retains the Internet\u2019s hourglass architecture but evolves the thin waist to allow the creation of completely general distribution networks. The core element of this evolution is removing the restriction that packets can only name communication endpoints. As far as the network is concerned, the name in an NDN packet can be anything\u2014an endpoint, a chunk of movie or book, a command to turn on some lights, etc. This simple change allows NDN networks\u00a0\u2026",

While the use of public key cryptography in RFID tags mitigates many difficult security issues, certain important usability-related issues remain, particularly when RFID tags are used for financial transactions or for bearer identification. In this paper, we focus exclusively on techniques with user involvement for secure user-to-tag authentication, transaction verification, reader expiration and revocation checking, as well as association of RFID tags with other personal devices.

Many key management schemes assume either manually pre-installed shared secrets or keys authenticated with the aid of out-of-band channels. While manually installing secret keys affects the practicability of the key deployment, out-of-band channels require additional interfaces of already hardware-limited wireless sensor nodes. In this work, we present a key deployment protocol that uses pair-wise ephemeral keys generated from physical layer information which subsequently enables an authenticated exchange of public keys. Hence, this work presents an elegant solution to the key deployment problem without requiring more capabilities than already available on common low-cost devices. To justify the feasibility of this solution, we implement and experimentally evaluate the\u00a0\u2026",

If these users (and their devices) have no prior association, a new security context must be established. In order to prevent potential attacks, the initial context (association) establishment process must involve only the intended devices and their users. A number of methods for initial secure association of two devices have been proposed; their usability factors have been explored and compared extensively. However, a more challenging problem of initial secure association of a group of devices (and users) has not received much attention. Although a few secure group association methods have been proposed, their usability aspects have not been studied, especially, in a comparative manner.

In particular, some applications require direct communication between two or more wireless personal devices that have no prior context and no common point of trust or pre-shared secrets.

In the absence of prior security context, the need to involve the user in the pairing process is a prominent challenge. In this paper, we investigate the use of the audio channel for human-assisted device pairing. First we assume a common (insecure) wireless channel between devices. We then obviate the assumption of a pre-existing common channel with a single-channel device pairing approach only based on audio. Both approaches are applicable to a wide range of devices and place light burden on the user.",

As the number of different entities having access to a database increases, it gets harder to prevent and trace-back data leakage. We address the problems of proving ownership and unauthorized data distribution (leakage) for relational databases. We propose three techniques that altogether may be used to detect, deter and trace-back data leaks from relational databases. We use business process outsourcing scenarios as the descriptive use case, but our techniques are equally applicable in other use cases when a relational database is shared among many parties and its confidentiality and authenticity needs to be protected. Previous work has shown how to watermark and fingerprint numerical relational data to prove ownership and track unauthorized redistributions respectively. This work represents the first attempt to find more general solutions that can practically accommodate relational data with non-numerical or error sensitive attributes that are common in corporate databases.",

However, organizing comparative usability tests is laborious, since either complete application implementations or partial user interface mockups need to be implemented for each tested method. Testing distributed applications requires even more work, since implementing mere user interface mockups is not enough; networking functionality needs to be implemented as well to achieve the real user experience. In this paper we present a usability test framework for one distributed application type: pairing methods. Our framework supports automated test sessions, automatic test data collection and error condition simulation. Developing new pairing method mockups for user testing is easy and fast using the framework, and existing pairing method implementations can be plugged to the framework for testing with minimal changes.",

Our design prevents forged IP packets from entering the network and accessing the destination service, while assuring simple and fast access to compliant users. Our system enforces user authentication on the IP level, periodically stamping each IP packet with a unique, identity-based signature of the sender. Spoofed packets are detected as soon as they arrive at the source authenticating router, by detecting discrepancies between signatures in the packet headers and their declared IP address or by checking special markings. In addition, we use capabilities to enable the receivers to decide which senders are allowed to send traffic. Hence, our architecture limits the impact of DoS attacks, which use either spoofed or non-spoofed IP traffic. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has used Identity Based Signatures for IP host authentication. We propose an IBS-based solution that addresses a broad range of network vulnerabilities. We implemented our design as a router module to measure the associated performance degradation and demonstrate its potential for Internet-wide deployment."

Internet users have a limited set of tools available at their disposal to enable better communication, including Tor [3] and new protocols such as tcpcrypt [8, 9] and DNS-over-TLS [32]. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging (inter-) networking architecture with the goal of becoming an alternative to the IP-based Internet. Such an architecture must at least have parity with IP based solutions for anonymous communication. Thus, there is a clear demand for a CCN analog to Tor and related protocols. ANDaNA (Anonymous Named Data Networking Application) was the initial attempt to satisfy this demand for CCNs in the context of the legacy Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture\u2013an instance of CCN. However, its elementary design and hasty implementation led to performance and usability issues that hinder practical use. In this paper, we introduce AC3N: Anonymous Communication for Content-Centric Networking, a substantially evolved and improved incarnation of ANDaNA. AC3N supports high-throughput and low-latency anonymous content retrieval in modern CCNs, for both unidirectional and bidirectional settings. We discuss the design, implementation, performance, and anonymity properties of AC3N. Our experimental results indicate that AC3N incurs very low overhead while providing anonymity features analogous to Tor."

        "description": "One prominent open problem with RFID tags that support public key cryptography is revocation of reader certificates. This is an important issue considering that highend RFID tags are geared for public key applications such as e-documents and contactless payment instruments. Furthermore, the problem is unique to public key-based RFID systems, since tags have no clock and thus cannot use traditional (time-based) off-line revocation checking methods. Whereas, on-line methods require unrealistic connectivity assumptions. We address the problem of reader revocation in PKI-Based RFID systems. We begin by observing an important distinguishing feature of personal RFID tags used in authentication, access control or payment applications-the involvement of a human user. We then take advantage of the user\u2019s awareness and presence to construct a simple, efficient, secure and (most importantly) feasible solution for reader revocation checking. And finally, we evaluate our solution via a user study and a discussion of its application feasibility. In our approach, the main extra feature is the requirement for a small passive on-tag display. However, modern low-power display technology is low-cost and appealing for other security purposes such as user-to-tag authentication and transaction verification."
