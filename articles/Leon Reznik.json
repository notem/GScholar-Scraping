To study Rekognition robustness to adversarial attacks, we manipulate the videos by adding the noise to them.

We define the robustness of an ML model as the ability to maintain a certain level of performance under variable levels of DQ at its input. We employ the classification accuracy as the performance metric for the ML classifiers studied. The POWDER testbed is utilized to create an experimental setup consisting of a real-world wireless network connecting two nodes.

In the case when the GPS signal becomes unstable, other auxiliary navigation systems, such as computer-vision-based positioning, are employed for more accurate localization and mapping. However, the quality of data obtained from AV\u2019s sensors might be deteriorated by the extreme environmental conditions too, which infinitely leads to the decrease in navigation performance. To verify our computer-vision-based localization system design, we considered the Arctic region use case, which poses additional challenges for the AV\u2019s navigation and might employ artificial visual landmarks for improving the localization quality, which we used for the computer vision training. We further enhanced our data by applying affine transformations to increase its diversity. We selected YOLOv4 image detection architecture for our system design, as it demonstrated the highest performance in our experiments. For the computational platform, we employed a Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier device, as it is well known and widely used in robotic and AV computer vision, as well as deep learning applications. Our empirical study showed that the proposed computer vision system that was further trained on the dataset enhanced by affine transformations became robust regarding image quality degradation caused by extreme environmental conditions.

To address the classical Reputation zero value challenge, we introduce the DQ evaluation service, which allows to use the vehicle\u2019s objective characteristics to assign the initial Reputation value to a new agent when it is joining the group. To validate our approach, we conducted an empirical study on real intersection traffic with multiple vehicles.

These include resource consumption, features, portability, interface complexity, ease of parallelization, etc. Considerations such as language compatibility and familiarity with a particular library make the choice of libraries even more difficult. The paper introduces MeetCI, an open source software framework for computational intelligence software design automation that facilitates the application design decisions and their software implementation process.

This innovation has a high potential to enable a significant improvement in a wide spectrum of science and technology applications as it will create new opportunities for optimizing data structures, data processing and fusion procedures based on a new quality and security information application. While the developed evaluation techniques may cover a wide range of data sources, the current framework\u2019s implementation concentrates on using an ordinary user\u2019s owned mobile devices and Android-based smartphones in particular. After discussing a motivation and general concepts of data quality evaluation, we will present preliminary results. As the framework integrates various metrics from accuracy to security and privacy, we will show examples of cyberinfrastructure elements from those areas developed so far. The security evaluation aspect of the framework is introduced with the Android applications that evaluate a smartphone security, gives a comprehensive score, and advises how the smartphone security can be improved. Two applications that are already available on Google Play will be presented and discussed. In addition, we will show some examples of the framework\u2019s user interface designed for data quality metrics assignment and demonstrate its visualization capabilities. The data privacy evaluation is presented with the investigation of the colluded application vulnerability\u00a0\u2026"

Not only do these sensors come in different form factors but the software that comes bundled with them also varies from device to device and is constantly evolving. Also, multiple types of sensors on these devices are used to recognize human activity. Owing to the flexible form factor, these devices can also be mounted on a plethora of different positions on the human body. With all the aforementioned variables, it becomes imperative that the quality of data provided by wearable sensors needs to be evaluated. This paper describes an empirical study resulting in evaluating the accuracy of human activity recognition by wearable sensors based on the type of sensor, the physical mounting position of the sensor on the human body, their type of activity being monitored and the type of device being used.

No polynomial-time algorithm is currently known to the public by which the quadratic residue status of one number modulo another may be determined.

        "description": "Big Data phenomenon is a result of novel technological developments in sensor, computer and communication technologies. Nowadays more and more data are produced by nanoscale photonic, optoelectronic and electronic devices. However, their quality characteristics could be very low. The paper proposes new methods of the data management with huge data amounts that is based on associating of data quality indicators with each data entity. To achieve this goal, one needs to define the composition of the data quality indicators and to develop their integration calculus. As data quality evaluation involves multidisciplinary research, various metrics have been investigated. The paper describes two major approaches in assigning the data quality indicators and developing their integration calculus. The information systems approach employs traditional high-level metrics like data accuracy, consistency and completeness. The engineering approach utilizes signal characteristics processed with the probability based calculus. The data quality metrics composition and calculus are discussed. The tools developed to automate the metrics selection and calculus procedures are presented. The user-friendly interface examples are provided. Copyright\u00a9 2015",

In doing so, we hope to reveal the extent to which computer security practices are influenced by day-to-day occupations and activities. To accomplish this task we created and distributed a survey tailored towards laymen using a variety of social media channels to acquire a large enough respondent sample size to produce data worthy of statistical analysis. Then, we analyzed this data by comparing the security practices of users in certain occupations against general users. We also analyzed the relative risk of a user\u2019s security practices when exposed to certain occupations. This helped support our assessment of which occupations generally have users with superior computer security practices. Our results show that users in engineering, technology, and healthcare fields have statistically superior security practices regarding password policies and use of security mechanisms (eg firewalls and antivirus solutions). Using the data and observations from our analysis, we also provide general suggestions and recommendations for users to improve their computer security practices.",

The sheer quantity of data and growing need for real-time ingestion of sensor data (e.g., alerts and forecasts from physical models) means that automated Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) is necessary to ensure that the data collected is fit for purpose. Current automated QA/QC approaches provide assessments based upon hard classifications of the gathered data; often as a binary decision of good or bad data that fails to quantify our confidence in the data for use in different applications. We propose a novel framework for automated data quality assessments that uses Fuzzy Logic to provide a continuous scale of data quality. This continuous quality scale is then used to compute error bars upon the data, which quantify the data uncertainty and provide a more meaningful measure of the data\u2019s fitness for purpose in a particular application compared with hard quality classifications. The design principles of the framework are presented and enable both data statistics and expert knowledge to be incorporated into the uncertainty assessment. We have implemented and tested the framework upon a real time platform of temperature and conductivity sensors that have been deployed to monitor the Derwent Estuary in Hobart, Australia. Results indicate that the error bars generated from the Fuzzy QA/QC implementation are in good agreement with the error bars manually encoded by a domain expert.",

A particular consideration is given to partially connected neural networks that open another way of tuning the ANN structure toward the application.

They are designed to take an advantage of receiving sensor signals from networked sensors by building the models of the sensor signals and, on the higher network levels, objects under measurement. The methods are based on statistical processing of the measurement results coming from sensors and employing those models to detect the anomalies caused either by an equipment malfunctioning or human malicious activities and mistakes.

The conservation scheme switches sensor nodes between a sleep and an active mode in a manner such that the nodes can maximize the time they spend in a power-efficient sleep state, which corresponds to a nonmeasuring and/or nontransmitting mode, while not missing important events. A switching decision is made based on changes (or their absence) in the signals sensed from the environment by an intelligent agent that has been trained to determine whether or not a special event has occurred.

        "description": "The paper describes applications of a modified timebased multilayer perceptron (MTBMLP), which is a complex structure composed from a few time-based multilayer perceptrons with a reduced connectivity. The modification reduces connections, isolates information for each function and produces knowledge about the system of functions as a whole. This neural network is applied for change detection in signals delivered by sensor networks and for edge detection in image processing. In both applications a MTBMLP is utilized for function predictions and, after a further structure development is implemented, for an error prediction also. In sensor network applications, a number of experiments with Crossbow sensor kits and the MTBMLP acting as a function predictor have been conducted and analyzed for detecting a significant change in signals of various shapes and nature. A series of experiments with Lena image have been conducted for edge detection applications. The results demonstrate that MTBMLP is more efficient and reliable than other methodologies in sensor network change detection and that its application in in edge detection is also feasible.",

SNADS will provide a cross-platform management of core SN operation. Although SN is built as a synergy of a variety of modules, the system centerpiece is a collection of intelligent agents realizing different computational intelligence and machine learning techniques employed for change detection in signals coming from sensors. The agents may have various levels of intelligence from a simple comparison against the thresholds through the rules system to neural networks structures distributed over the sensor network nodes. The system is written in Java and could be implemented with the JVM technology. The system composition and component design are described. Implementation details are given.",

The system utilizes a neural network function prediction methodology to predict sensor outputs in order to determine if the sensor outputs are novel. In addition to the novelty detection system, a modification to a standard neural network function predictor is proposed that allows the novelty detection system to quickly learn to accurately predict next sensor outputs. The parameter choice and the relationship between the threshold values and false alarm and missing attack rates are studied and recommendations are provided.",

The fact that sensor networks represent a concurrent data acquisition system is rarely paid a proper attention. Sensor networks bring up a wealth of information on the object or process under measurement and the environment, and this information can as well be applied effectively for enhancing their own security and reliability. The paper proposes an investigation and development of more complex sensor network protocols with intelligent operations performed at the aggregate nodes. The protocol will compare the association information about measured variables with the current measurement results. Association information could be given a priori or generated during an application session.",

In order to make high-quality decisions, one has to fuse information of different kinds from a variety of sources with differing degrees of reliability and uncertainty. The necessity to use intelligent methodologies in the analysis of such systems is demonstrated as well as the inspiring relation of computational intelligence to its natural counterpart.

Another one constitutes an expansion of neuro-fuzzy control into new application fields in both engineering (telecommunications, first but not the least to mention) and non-engineering (business, social sciences) areas. The development of the second direction is very closely tied with an application of fuzzy methodology in data analysis and acquisition.

Due to the success of mathematical morphology in processing binary images, there have been many successful attempts to generalize its methods to more general, i.e. gray-tone images. One of these attempts\u2014the most intuitive one is based on replacing sets by fuzzy sets, thus defining so called fuzzy morphological operations. In this paper we show that these operations can be used successfully in nonimage applications. We can use methods developed in fuzzy mathematical morphology to compute the membership functions of different \"approximate\" statements. Also, an application to interval-valued knowledge representation is given.",

Suitable models of a hydraulic water brake dynamometer and a spark-ignition, four stroke engine are presented in this paper. These models can be linked to form the complete plant model suitable for control system design.  The engine model proposed in this paper allows various engines and configurations to be studied with few input parameter changes. A major advantage of this model is in the ease of implementing different engine configurations by simply specifying a single full throttle torque curve and a number of engine parameters. In this way \u201cpaper engines\u201d can be modelled without the necessity of \u201creal engine\u201d tests to ascertain performance parameters."

The system considers the speed deviation (\u0394\u03c9) and applies a nonlinear scaling for this parameter based on operational sectors, that can provide scaling as well as phase (sign) to \u0394\u03c9 and associated inputs.

In the majority of real-life measurement situations, we more or less know beforehand what kind of results we will get. Of course, this is not the precise knowledge of the type\\the result will be between a? and a+\", because in this case, we would not need any measurements at all. This is usually a knowledge that is best represented in uncertain terms, like\\perhaps (or\\most likely\", etc.) the measured value x is between a? and a+\".Traditional statistical methods neglect this additional knowledge and process only the measurement results. So it is desirable to be able to process this uncertain knowledge as well. A natural way to process it is by using fuzzy logic. But there is a problem: we can use di erent membership functions to represent the same uncertain statements, and di erent functions lead to di erent results. What membership function to choose?",

        "description": "In many applied problems (geophysics, medicine, and astronomy) we cannot directly measure the values x(t) of the desired physical quantity x in different moments of time, so we measure some related quantity y(t), and then we try to reconstruct the desired values x(t). This problem is often ill-posed in the sense that two essentially different functions x(t) are consistent with the same measurement results. So, in order to get a reasonable reconstruction, we must have some additional prior information about the desired function x(t). Methods that use this information to choose x(t) from the set of all possible solutions are called regularization methods. In some cases, we know the statistical characteristics both of x(t) and of the measurement errors, so we can apply statistical filtering methods (well-developed since the invention of a Wiener filter). In some situations, we know the properties of the desired process, e.g., we know that the derivative of x(t) is limited by some number delta, etc. In this case, we can apply standard regularization techniques (e.g., Tikhonov's regularization). In many cases, however, we have only uncertain knowledge about the values of x(t), about the rate with which the values of x(t) can change, and about the measurement errors. In these cases, usually one of the existing regularization methods is applied. There exist several heuristics that choose such a method. The problem with these heuristics is that they often lead to choosing different methods, and these methods lead to different functions x(t). Therefore, the results x(t) of applying these heuristic methods are often unreliable. We show that if we use fuzzy logic to describe this\u00a0\u2026",

The rates of successful change detections and false negatives are investigated for each change detection system for various signal noise levels, network training times, and detection threshold values. The novel ANN topologies tested will aid engineers in improving sensor network efficiency by reducing the computational costs of accurate sensor signal prediction. The experiments are conducted on a base station with six simulated sensor nodes."

        "description": "While numerous surveys in regards to computer security are conducted by organizations in order to study the behavior of their employees and users, the most influential in determining the security of general computer environment group of ordinary users is still lacking in attention. This paper presents the survey results of more than 3,000 computer users who participated in a survey conducted in 2010-2011 by Prof. Reznik\u2019s students at RIT. They researched the practice of home computer users including the passwords used, patching regularity, firewalls and anti-virus software application. The samples of results are analyzed and presented here. They may be utilized for improving overall computer security as well as for the education of users."

        "description": "The paper describes the development of a smart embedded fuzzy system for reefer refrigeration control. The goal of this project is twofold: to design an efficient and economically feasible intelligent industrial controller on one hand and to test and further develop a smart device design approach, which is based on design model formulation with the fuzzy rules given by an expert. Through prototyping and implementation on a generalpurpose microprocessor the system can then be tested and used to iteratively identify and control the plant until the desired control system criteria are achieved. The paper describes the design, implementation and testing of an embedded fuzzy controller as a simple, practical solution to a regulation problem in reefer refrigeration systems. By an application of the Motorola HC12 MCU with its inbuilt fuzzy logic instruction set a rapid prototype design was implemented and the application of fuzzy logic and iterative identification and control to general industrial refrigeration systems was found to be a possible economically feasible solution."
