To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset about community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit, annotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an utterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a popular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our model outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61% respectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations about needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about assets focus on location and entities."

Thus, reclaiming vacant lots and putting them to productive use is an important consideration for many cities. Given a large number of vacant lots and resource constraints for conversion, two key questions for a city are (1) whether to convert a vacant lot or not; and (2) what to convert a vacant lot as. We seek to provide computational support to answer these questions. To this end, we identify the determinants of a vacant lot conversion and build a recommender based on those determinants. We evaluate our models on real-world vacant lot datasets from the US cities of Philadelphia,PA and Baltimore, MD. Our results indicate that our recommender yields mean F-measures of (1) 90% in predicting whether a vacant lot should be converted or not within a single city, (2) 91% in predicting what a vacant lot should be converted to, within a single city and, (3) 85% in predicting whether a vacant lot should be converted or not across two cities.",

However, the service composition environment is highly dynamic, which poses unique challenges for algorithm selection.

The variables in concerned were analysed using the Kaiser Varimax Rotation for factor analysis to show the correlation and level of significance exhibited. The SPSS software version 20 was used for this purpose. Findings: Findings in the study showed that there are disparities in the employment generation trends among the selected SMEs which are as a result of inequity in finance, policy discontinuity, insecurity, lack of awareness, ineffective market linkages, among others. The correlation matrix shows that the variables are seen to correlate at the minimum significance level thus proving our hypothesis of how significant the impact SMEs have on employment generation. Also the extraction values of all the variables are quite high indicating that they are good extraction values and as the acceptable cumulative% value is 60%, our eight variables used have been reduced to four factors which explain our total variance at a cumulative% of 69%; this clearly shown that 69% of the variance is explained by four (4) distinct factors. The result however showed that all the variables exhibit good relationship among each other which also implies that they have great impact on employment generation as their factor loading is very\u00a0\u2026",

With time, failure to sell or find alternate uses for vacant lots results in them causing adverse effects on the health and safety of residents, and cost the city both directly and indirectly. Although existing research has tried to define these impacts, cities need quantifiable evidence from within the city to make planning decisions based on these studies. Moreover, trying to understand the impact of vacant lots in an uncontrolled setting makes it difficult to perform A key problem with existing methodologies is that they tend to look at the city as a whole, while ignoring the diverse socioeconomic factors at play. Altogether, city planners are left with little or no actionable information to prioritize conversion of vacant lots. In contrast, for our research we try to model the city as blocks, census tracts and neighborhoods while using relevant features to capture key demographic, economic and geographic characteristics. In addition, we build a deep learning model to quantify the impact of vacant lots on changing property values so as to recommend conversions that yields the maximum benefit through property value tax increase. Our results indicate that our model is able to capture the relationship between vacant lots and property values better than conventionally used algorithms and data models. Further, our model specifically caters to small and mid size cities, which are often neglected in the mainstream urban computing research.",

Results of analysis of the nutrient solutions reveal a declining concentration of all the analysed PFASs, suggesting that they were taken up or were adsorbed by the roots, and with different effciency depending upon the compound chain length and functional group. Regarding the effects of the willow plants exposure to PFASs, analysis of photosynthetic parameters reveals that these pollutants seem to exert a positive effect on photosynthesis, so suggesting that willow species can be good candidates for phytoremediation of PFASs. However, further analysis are needed to clarify the results obtained and to verify the effects of these pollutants in long-term experiments."

The method first determines the number of copies of the files to be stored in the system to achieve the desired goal (eg, to satisfy file availability requirements, or to maximize the system hit rate), and then selects the nodes at which to store the file copies to minimize the total expected cost. The file replication scheme for a peer-to-peer file sharing system in a distributed and adaptive manner can scale to a large number of nodes and files and can handle changes in the user request pattern over time.",

The films were characterized in terms of drug-excipient compatibility by FTIR, drug content, swelling, folding endurance, thermal behaviour by DSC, effect of processing parameters on drug state (amorphous or crystalline) by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and in vitro drug release profiles. The results confirm that there was no interaction between the drug-polymers and fusion of drug crystals within the polymer matrix. Results of XRD indicate partial dissolution of drug within the polymer matrix and suggested it was partly distributed in amorphous form throughout the film. The weight variation, thickness and folding endurance of films were in the range of 2.170\u00b10.05 to 2.444\u00b10.23 gm, 1.120\u00b10.032 to 1.125\u00b10.011 mm and 200\u00b15 to 400\u00b15, respectively. The pH values of the different films were between 6.8 to 7.21. After 24 h, the best selected film shows 75% and 90% of drug release in 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) and in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), respectively. Based on these results it is suggested that the incorporation of drug into the hydrophilic floating film may be an appropriate strategy to improve the dissolution profile and oral bioavailability of the drug.",

Distance and Density based clustering algorithm can greatly improve energy efficiency of WSNs because it adopts a multi-hop communication in each cluster. Besides, the neighborhood of the sink node (SN) will perform direct transmission to relieve the workload of CHs. Load balancing and scalability are very crucial factors which plays important role in the selection of Cluster head.

Such cloud capability estimation and selection can be a big challenge since most clouds can be considered as black-boxes to cloud users by abstracting underlying infrastructures and technologies. This paper describes a cloud recommender system to recommend an optimal cloud configuration to users based on accurate estimates. To achieve this, our system generates the capability vector that consists of relative performance scores of resource types (e.g., CPU, memory, and disk) estimated for given user workload using benchmarks.

This is critical from the perspective of user fairness in customer-facing systems, correctness in stream processing systems, and so on. In this paper, we consider optimizing ordered throughput for near real-time, data-intensive, independent computations using cloud bursting. Intercloud computation of data-intensive applications is a challenge due to large data transfer requirements, low intercloud bandwidth, and best-effort traffic on the Internet. The system model we consider is comprised of two processing stages. The first stage uses cloud bursting opportunistically for parallel processing, while the second stage (sequential) expects the output of the first stage to be in the same order as the arrival sequence. We propose three scheduling heuristics as part of an autonomic cloud bursting\u00a0\u2026",

As such, some assumptions used by these protocols are not valid in MANETs or some protocols cannot efficiently handle topology changes. The Efficient routing protocols can provide significant benefits to mobile ad hoc networks, in terms of both performance and reliability. The most popular Routing protocols are Optimized Link State Protocol (OLSR) Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO), Location-Aided Routing (LAR), Landmark Ad-hoc Routing Protocol (LANMAR). Despite the popularity of those protocols, research efforts have not focused much in evaluating their performance when applied to variable bit rate (VBR). In this paper we present our observations regarding the performance comparison of the above protocols in terms of packet delivery, throughput, jitter and end-to-end delay in mobile ad hoc networks.

While cloud-bursting is addressing this process of scaling up and down across data centers (i.e. between private and public clouds), offering service level guarantees, is a challenge for inter-cloud computation, particularly for best-effort traffic and large files. The parallel workload we address is real-time and involves inter-cloud processing and analysis of images and documents. In our production printing domain, dedicated processing/network resources are cost-prohibitive. Further, the problem is exacerbated by data intensive computing - we encounter huge file sizes atypical of intercloud parallel processing.

We study unconventional computing environments containing devices spread throughout a single large organization. The devices are not necessarily typical general purpose machines; instead, they could be processors dedicated to special purpose tasks (for example printing and document processing), but capable of being leveraged for distributed computations. Harvesting their idle cycles can simultaneously help resources cooperate to perform their primary task and enable additional functionality and services. A new burstiness metric characterizes the volatility of the high-priority native tasks. A burstiness-aware scheduling heuristic opportunistically introduces grid jobs (a lower priority workload class) to avoid the higher-priority native applications, and effectively harvests idle cycles\u00a0\u2026",

The time multiplexing in single code design makes code blocking zero with additional time slot management requirement. It provides additional benefit of handling non-quantized data rates.

We verify the effectiveness of the file replication schemes via simulation.

Counter to this view, the key emerging idea is that of a network of Multi-Function Devices 1 (MFD) providing service as a collaborative system. This idea enables the service provider to define additional services over the collection of devices. By assuming a multi-agent perspective of this service-oriented environment, we propose an autonomic mechanism through which the collection of devices can self-organize. The self-organization is carried out in two steps - firstly, the devices assemble themselves in to a meaningful structure and subsequently configure themselves by assuming suitable roles in the distributed multi-agent system. Upon self-organization, devices may exhibit better immunity to\u00a0\u2026",

The health hazards could be markedly lowered with adoption of some of the low cost practices such as repeated washings, exposure of the produce to sunlight and raising the crops on beds. The coliform counts in vegetables were within permissible limits by two washings with water, exposing these to sunlight for about 4 h and removing the two outmost leaves of cabbage. Also, cutting above some height from ground level (0.10 m) in sorghum reduced the pollution load in fodder crops."

Because the pathogen infects nursery stock, quarantine measures are currently used to prevent the spread of Pr based on detection using immunological assays such as ELISA, molecular diagnosis using PCR, and isolation onto Phytophothora-selective media. To compare the performance of these assays, a block of 300 camellia plants was chosen at a California nursery known to be infested with Pr. Disease symptoms, such as foliar lesions and leaf drop were recorded for each plant (as was the presence of moss) prior to foliar and potting medium sampling. Four-seven leaves and 500 ml medium were collected from each plant. Healthy camellia leaves were used as bait to isolate Pr from the potting medium of each plant.

Results showed that the use of anticoagulants resulted in minor to major alterations in the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase (ACP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Significant inhibitions in the activities of ALAT, ALP and LDH by the anticoagulants EDTA, citrate and oxalate were observed. On the other hand, the use of EDTA and oxalate resulted in a significant increase in the ACP activity. Heparin produced minor alterations to enzyme activities."

Depending on the type of trade and length of journey, meat is transported by road in insulated or refrigerated vechicles. Usually dressed carcasses and offals are packed with ice and transported to processing plants. Various factors are responsible for changes in sensory and microbial quality of fresh meat during transporation. Lanier (1978) revealed that discoloration of insufficiently chilled beef occurring in transit. Bell and Garout (1994) conducted transport and storage trials of vaccum packaged beef carcasses and observed that beef of normal pH can be preserved upto 90 days. Sharma (1994) reported on quality changes in buffalo meat transportation under ice and changes due to repeated freezing and thawing of meat. The Present study was conducted to study the physio-chemical, microbial and sensory changes of buffalo meat and liver during storage in ice pack.",

In the T1 and T2 groups all the feed ingredients were the same as in the control and only concentrate allowance was 15 and 30% higher than in the control. All the experimental animals were fed for 90 days and a digestion cum-metabolic trial was conducted before parturition. There was an increasing trend in the digestibility of DM, OM, CF, CP and N-free extract in both treatment groups, but within the treatments, no difference was observed. All experimental pregnant heifers maintained a fairly good nitrogen balance and 50% of the absorbed nitrogen was retained. Liveweight gain of pregnant heifers (6-9 months) was 340, 453 and 487 g/head/d in the control, T1 and T2 groups, respectively. Weight gain was significantly higher than control in the two treatment groups but within the treatments it was not significant. It may be inferred from the results that buffalo heifers may be fed 20% higher nutrients in the later part of pregnancy so that they can attain a body weight upto 500 kg before calving in their first lactation.",

The chemical composition of diet illustrated that crude protein in wheat straw was increased from 2.70-6.90% due to ammoniation process. The apparent digestibilities of DM, OM, CP, CF and NFE were similar in all groups indicating uniformity of various feed ingredients consumed by the buffaloes. Voluntary DM intake was significantly higher (P< 0.05) in 2 treatment groups as compared to control. The milk yield and composition remained unaffected and the differences in overall milk yield was nonsignificant. There was an increasing trend in milk yield due to the supplementation of 15 and 30% concentrate. The chemical composition of milk showed no difference in the 2 treatment groups.

A numerical technique was used for the computation of bridge leakage reactance of the closed rotor slot for various values of rotor bar current. The computed values were compared with the measured one. For evaluation of performance of the motor, equivalent circuit approach was adopted taking into account the nonlinearity of various parameters.

A separate code translator GENCRAY is modified to render code into parallel f77. Generated parallel routines run under the control of existing FEA packages. Examples of generated code are also presented.",

In this experimental work, an attempt has been made to design and fabricate an experimental set-up that comprises of two centrifugal pumps arranged in such a manner that the experimental set-up works either individually or in series and in parallel combinations. The maximum value of efficiency estimated is 62.45% for C1 and 65.30% for C2, 55.10% and 58.15%, when pumps operate individually, in series and in parallel combination, respectively. The designed and fabricated test rig has efficiently served the purpose of providing a clear idea about the effectiveness of experimental set-up in transmitting fluid to distant work stations. This study indicated the methodology could be used to transfer gases or liquid to long distances by using more number of pumps in series and parallel combinations."

Extraction socket augmentation for future implant therapy does not rule out immediate implant placement but rather provides an additional option when treatment planning implant patients. This article will focus on the concept of extraction socket preservation using regenerative materials. It will describe a technique suggested by the authors to resist bone resorption and soft tissue shrinkage following tooth extraction."

The use of national income as a proxy of national welfare was done just because of the non-availability of any reliable alternative. Besides since national income can serve many purposes, a majority of controversies, problems and errors of measurements of national income accounts seem to arise due to:1. lack of clear specification of the purpose for which these accounts are being used; 2. use of these accounts for various\u00a0\u2026"

        "description": "Cloud Computing is the most emerging trend in Information Technology now days. Number of users used Cloud to store their data. The need for online services is increasing; the extent of services available through the internet, such as online software, platform, storage, etc. is also growing. This leads to formation of a structured provision of services, called cloud computing, which actually provides a huge amount of computing resources as services through the internet. One of the important services in the cloud is the availability of online storage, called cloud storage. Data storage security: It is security of data on the storage media. In cloud computing security is an important factor for ensuring clients that in the cloud, data is placed on a secure mode. For protecting Data from malicious users, client authentication becomes an important task. The global computing infrastructure is rapidly moving towards cloud based architecture. Adopting cloud technology can be an affordable way to get access to a dynamically scalable, virtualized computing environment. The cloud provider is responsible for the environment, so organizations can make use of resources for short periods of time without having to maintain the environment when it is not being used. While cloud computing models are attractive because of their flexibility and cost effectiveness. This paper is focused on the security issues of cloud computing. Before analyzing the security issues, the introduction to cloud computing and brief discussion on the cloud service model or cloud development models is presented. Then discusses the cloud layered architecture and cloud security challenges. This\u00a0\u2026"

        "description": "This paper focuses on recommending optimal cloud configuration for deploying complex user workloads. Such recommendation has become imperative in recent times for cloud users to reduce complexity in selecting a configuration. The number of different configuration options has increased many-fold due to the proliferation of cloud providers and different non-standardized offerings from these providers. Furthermore, the performance and price implications are unknown beforehand, when a cloud user deploys her workload into these different configurations. The problem gets exacerbated since cloud providers generally keep the underlying infrastructures and technologies non-transparent to users. In this paper, we present (i) a benchmark-based modeling approach to accurately estimate the performance of workloads on target black-box cloud configurations; and (ii) a search algorithm that first generates a capability vector consisting of relative performance scores of resource types (eg, CPU, memory, and disk) for each configuration and then, identifies a near optimal cloud configuration based on the capability vectors. Experiments show that our approach accurately estimates the performance capability, and performs efficient search for the near optimal cloud configuration that has the minimum price while meeting the throughput goal."

        "description": "This paper describes a framework for decentralized clustering-based analysis and online anomaly detection for self-monitoring of peer systems. The framework enables peer behavior patterns and anomalies to be effectively detected and reported so that corrective or otherwise corresponding action can be taken. In this system, it is assumed that peers represent their status using commonly known attributes and periodically report them as semantic events. Anomalies in the behavior/state of peers can then be detected by clustering these events based on the values of the attributes. The design and evaluation of a decentralized and scalable clustering algorithm that builds on a content-based routing, messaging and notification substrate is presented. The operation and performance of the algorithm is experimentally evaluated."
