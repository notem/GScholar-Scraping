        "description": "Mobile apps are widely used and often process users\u2019 sensitive data. Many taint analysis tools have been applied to analyze sensitive information flows and report data leaks in apps. These tools require a list of sources (where sensitive data is accessed) as input, and researchers have constructed such lists within the Android platform by identifying Android API methods that allow access to sensitive data. However, app developers may also define methods or use third-party library\u2019s methods for accessing data. It is difficult to collect such source methods, because they are unique to the apps, and there are a large number of third-party libraries available on the market that evolve over time. To address this problem, we propose DAISY, a Dynamic-Analysis-Induced Source discoverY approach for identifying methods that return sensitive information from apps and third-party libraries.

        "description": "While the emerging Augmented Reality (AR) technique allows a lot of new application opportunities, from education and communication to gaming, current augmented apps often have complaints about their usability and/or user experience due to placement errors of virtual objects. Therefore, identifying noticeable placement errors is an important goal in the testing of AR apps. However, placement errors can only be perceived by human beings and may need to be confirmed by multiple users, making automatic testing very challenging. In this paper, we propose PredART, a novel approach to predict human ratings of virtual object placements that can be used as test oracles in automated AR testing. PredART is based on automatic screenshot sampling, crowd sourcing, and a hybrid neural network for image regression. The evaluation on a test set of 480 screenshots shows that our approach can achieve an\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "With the development of augmented reality (AR) technology, the use of mobile AR applications (MAR apps) is rising rapidly in various aspects of people\u2019s everyday lives, such as games, shopping, and education. When compared to traditional apps, AR apps typically need access to the smartphone\u2019s camera all the time and collect and analyze significantly more data, such as sensor data, geolocation, and biometric information. Due to the sensitivity and volume of data collected by MAR apps, new privacy concerns are raised. In this paper, we describe a preliminary empirical study of Android MAR apps in terms of the sensitive data collected by MAR apps, whether the collected data is well protected, and whether the data practice is publicly available so that users can learn about the data safety and make informed decisions when deciding which apps to install. In this study, we analyzed 390 real-world MAR apps and\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "Static taint analyses are widely-applied techniques to detect taint flows in software systems. Although they are theoretically conservative and de-signed to detect all possible taint flows, static taint analyses almost always exhibit false negatives due to a variety of implementation limitations. Dynamic programming language features, inaccessible code, and the usage of multiple programming languages in a software project are some of the major causes. To alleviate this problem, we developed a novel approach, DySTA, which uses dynamic taint analysis results as additional sources for static taint analysis. However, na\u00efvely adding sources causes static analysis to lose context sensitivity and thus produce false positives. Thus, we developed a hybrid context matching algorithm and corresponding tool, ConDySTA, to preserve context sensitivity in DySTA.

        "description": "Mobile application (app) developers commonly utilize analytic services to analyze their app users' behavior to support debugging, improve service quality, and facilitate advertising. Anonymization and aggregation can reduce the sensitivity of such behavioral data, therefore analytic services often encourage the use of such protections. However, these protections are not directly enforced so it is possible for developers to misconfigure the analytic services and expose personal information, which may cause greater privacy risks. Since people use apps in many aspects of their daily lives, such misconfigurations may lead to the leaking of sensitive personal information such as a users' real-time location, health data, or dating preferences. To study this issue and identify potential privacy risks due to such misconfigurations, we developed a semi-automated approach, Privacy-Aware Analytics Misconfiguration Detector\u00a0\u2026",

Our framework will mine and generate bug patterns, detect those patterns in code, and calculate a vulnerability measure of software. While our framework performs well, we realize that it requires heavy manual tasks that render the framework infeasible to use in practice. However, we believe that recent advancements in machine learning will allow us to apply deep learning techniques to source code, which will help automate our framework for better practicality in the real world."
