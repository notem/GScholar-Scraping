Potentially it could be denser, could consume less energy, and could be more durable than conventional storage media such as hard drives, solid-state storage, and optical media. However, performing computations on the data stored in DNA is a largely unexplored challenge. This paper proposes an integrated circuit (IC) based on microfluidics that can perform complex operations such as artificial neural network (ANN) computation on data stored in DNA. We envision such a system to be suitable for highly dense, throughput-demanding bio-compatible applications such as an intelligent Organ-on-Chip or other biomedical applications that may not be latency-critical. It computes entirely in the molecular domain without converting data to electrical form, making it a form of in-memory computing on DNA. The computation is achieved by topologically modifying DNA strands through the use of enzymes called nickases. A novel scheme is proposed for representing data stochastically through the concentration of the DNA molecules that are nicked at specific sites. The paper provides details of the biochemical design, as well as the design, layout, and operation of the microfluidics device. Benchmarks are reported on the performance of neural network computation."

To enable this, automated warehousing is demanding unprecedented vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication rates and reliability. The 60 GHz frequency band can deliver multi-gigabit/second data rates to satisfy the increasing demands of network connectivity by smart warehouses. In this paper, we aim to investigate the network connectivity in the 60 GHz millimeter-wave band inside an automated warehouse. A key hindrance to robust and high-speed network connectivity, especially, at mmWave frequencies stems from numerous non-line-of-sight (nLOS) paths in the transmission medium due to various interacting objects such as metal shelves and storage boxes. The continual change in the warehouse storage configuration significantly affects the multipath reflected components and shadow fading effects, thus adding complexity to establishing stable, yet fast, network coverage. In this study, network connectivity in an automated warehouse is analyzed at 60 GHz using Network Simulator-3 (NS-3) channel simulations. We examine a simple warehouse model with several metallic shelves and storage materials of standard proportions. Our investigation indicates that the indoor warehouse network performance relies on the line-of-sight and nLOS propagation paths, the existence of reflective materials, and the autonomous material handling agents present around the access point (AP).

        "description": "In modern computing, which relies on the interconnection of networks used in many/multi-core systems, any system can be critically subverted if the interconnection is compromised. This can be done in a multitude of ways, but the threat of a hardware Trojan (HT) being injected into a system is particularly prevalent due to the increase in third-party manufacturers for system-on-chip (SoC) designs. With a local injection of an HT in an SoC, an adversary can gain access to information about applications running on the system by revealing specific communications of the SoC, and the network-on-chip (NoC) as a whole. This heavily compromises the system and gives information to the attacker, which can lead to more tailored, compromising attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate an HT that exploits communication patterns inside an SoC to reveal applications that are running on an NoC with multi/many-core processors. This is performed by leaking packet counts, after which the attacker then uses machine learning techniques to identify applications running on processors, and the SoC as a whole. We also propose a LUT-based obfuscation technique to limit the information available to the hardware Trojan. Our results indicate that this obfuscation method can reduce the accuracy of this attack from 99% to <8% in multi/many-core systems."

        "description": "Recent research has demonstrated that machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which small but carefully crafted input perturbations can lead to algorithm failure. It has been demonstrated that certain adversarial attack algorithms are capable of producing these types of perturbations. These attack methods are inapplicable when the attack must be generated in near real time. The use of a hardware accelerator, such as a Process-in-Memory (PIM) archi-tecture, is a potential method for addressing this issue. The PIM architecture is regarded as a superior option for data-intensive applications such as solving optimization problems and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) due to its capacity for ultra-low-latency parallel processing. However, implementing an adversarial attack algorithm directly on the PIM platform is inefficient due to the PIM architecture's complexity and overhead costs. To\u00a0\u2026",

Server consolidation can drastically reduce power consumption of datacenters by reducing the number of active servers. However, server consolidation alone can adversely affect network performance. Recently, wireless datacenters using millimeter-wave communications have been proposed and shown to drastically reduce power consumption of networking equipment. Therefore, server-consolidation strategies should leverage novel datacenter network-architectures to minimize power consumption with minimal impact on performance. We present network-aware bandwidth-constrained server consolidation algorithm called Network-Aware Server Consolidation (NASCon), for wireless datacenters that can reduce the power consumption up to 37%.

In case of a 3D IC chip stack, the individual chip faces are not available for mounting conventional heat sinks. Mounting the heat sinks on the ends is feasible, but the heat flow paths for the interior chips from the junction to the heat sink become longer. Further, multiple heat sources present along the heat flow paths in stacked chips may create localized hot spots which exceed the allowable junction temperatures. While 2.5D integration in complex ICs where individual layers are mounted on another base die called an interposer can alleviate the heat dissipation issues, it cannot deliver the benefits of monolithic 3D ICs due to the planar distance between the chips or chiplets over the interposer. Introducing interlayer cooling with microchannels and introducing fins in the coolant flow paths extend the thermal dissipation\u00a0\u2026",

An environment simulator predicts the distribution of future locations for each AMR and constructs a probability map for future AMR locations. A revised A* algorithm generates low-risk paths based on the probability map.

On the contrary, being an emerging technology, no study has been conducted on the security for the wireless datacenters. Being a wireless system, it has the potential to inherit many of the threats of a typical wireless network. So, in order to successfully realize wireless datacenter architectures, it is essential to do an extensive investigation of the system from a security perspective.

Recent research in optimizing the energy consumption of High Performance Computing (HPC) data centers mostly focuses on consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) and using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). These approaches are inherently hardware-based, are frequently unique to individual systems, and often use simulation due to lack of access to HPC data centers. Other approaches require profiling information on the jobs in the HPC system to be available before run-time. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based approach, which jointly optimizes profit and energy in the allocation of jobs to available resources, without the need for such prior information. The approach is implemented in a software scheduler used to allocate real applications from the Princeton Application Repository for Shared-Memory Computers (PARSEC) benchmark suite to a number of hardware nodes realized with Odroid-XU3 boards. Experiments show that the proposed approach increases the profit earned by 40% while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by 20% when compared to a heuristic-based approach. We also present a network-aware server consolidation algorithm called Bandwidth-Constrained Consolidation (BCC), for HPC data centers which can address the under-utilization problem of the servers. Our experiments show that the BCC consolidation technique can reduce the power consumption of a data center by up-to 37%.",

Processing in Memory (PIM) is envisioned as a potential hardware solution for such applications as the data access bottlenecks can be avoided in PIM by performing computations within the memory die. However, PIM realizations with logic-based complex processing units within the memory present complicated fabrication challenges. In this letter, we propose to leverage the existing memory infrastructure to implement a programmable PIM (pPIM), a novel Look-Up-Table (LUT)-based PIM where all the processing units are implemented solely with LUTs, as opposed to prior LUT-based PIM implementations that combine LUT with logic circuitry for computations.

        "description": "Modern warehouses utilize fleets of robots for inventory management. To ensure efficient and safe operation, real-time localization of each agent is essential. Most robots follow metal tracks buried in the floor and use a grid of precisely mounted RFID tags for localization. As robotic agents in warehouses and manufacturing plants become ubiquitous, it would be advantageous to eliminate the need for these metal wires and RFID tags. Not only do they suffer from significant installation costs, the removal of wires would allow agents to travel to any area inside the building. Sensors including cameras and LiDAR have provided meaningful localization information for many different positioning system implementations. Fusing localization features from multiple sensor sources is a challenging task especially when the target localization task\u2019s dataset is small. We propose a deep-learning based localization system which fuses features from an omnidirectional camera image and a 3D LiDAR point cloud to create a robust robot positioning model. Although the usage of vision and LiDAR eliminate the need for the precisely installed RFID tags, they do require the collection and annotation of ground truth training data. Deep neural networks thrive on lots of supervised data, and the collection of this data can be time consuming. Using a dataset collected in a warehouse environment, we evaluate the performance of two individual sensor models for localization accuracy. To minimize the need for extensive ground truth data collection, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining regimen to populate the image feature extraction network with meaningful weights\u00a0\u2026"

In most of these cases the antennas are placed horizontally on the substrate with the radiation orthogonal to the plane of the chip which results in low transmission in the plane of the chip. A vertical monopole has the desired radiation pattern but becomes electrically small which, in turn, makes the input impedance highly capacitive. Furthermore the silicon substrate reduces the radiation resistance. To address these issues, the present work presents a vertical top-hat monopole placed in silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) as the wireless interconnect. It has a ground plane in the shape of a disc to improve the radiation resistance. Matching is achieved by the top-hat that provides a capacitance and a shorting post connecting the top-hat to the\u00a0\u2026",

However, the increase in power density in 3D ICs due to reduced footprint aggravates the thermal issues in the chip. Liquid cooling through microfluidic channels can provide cooling capacities required for effective management of chip temperatures in 3D ICs. However, pumping liquid through the microchannels can cause high pressure-drops causing structural instability in the chip. In order to reduce the pressure drops and provide adequate cooling capability, the height and width of the microchannels needs to be increased.

        "description": "Inventory management and handling in warehouse environments have transformed large retail fulfillment centers. Often hundreds of autonomous agents scurry about fetching and delivering products to fulfill customer orders. Repetitive movements such as these are ideal for a robotic  platform to perform. One of the major hurdles for an autonomous system in a warehouse is accurate robot localization in a dynamic industrial environment. Previous LiDAR-based localization schemes such as adaptive Monte Carlo localization (AMCL) are effective in indoor environments and can  be initialized in new environments with relative ease. However, AMCL can be influenced negatively by accumulated odometry drift, and is also reliant primarily on a single modality for scene understanding which limits the localization performance. We propose a robust localization system which  combines multiple sensor sources and deep neural networks for accurate real-time localization in warehouses. Our system employs a novel deep neural network architecture consisting of multiple heterogeneous deep neural networks. The overall architecture employs a single multi-stream framework  to aggregate the sensor information into a final robot location probability distribution. Ideally, the integration of multiple sensors will produce a robust system even when one sensor fails to produce reliable scene information.",

In general during delay estimation from scheduling during HLS, only functional unit delay is considered. However for current generation of complex digital systems, interconnects (switching elements) also play a very vital role in effective delay evaluation. Thus consideration of interconnect/storage delay during delay estimation from scheduling during HLS becomes very significant, as inaccurate delay estimation inevitably misguides the exploration process during HLS. Motivating from this fact, this letter proposes an improved schedule delay estimation methodology divided into two phases:(a) process of identifying the operations that contribute to the effective delay of the operation chaining based scheduling (b) process of estimating schedule delay considering delay of interconnect (multiplexer unit) and storage elements (latches and final output register) besides regular functional units (FU). The proposed approach more comprehensively estimates the schedule delay than existing practice. Our results on various benchmarks confirm that proposed approach yields estimated delay more comprehensively (reported later) than current standard practice.",

However, to ensure the full benefits of this novel interconnect technology, design of simple, fair and efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) mechanism to grant access to the on-chip wireless communication channel is needed. Moreover, to adapt to the varying traffic demands from the applications running on a multicore environment, MAC mechanisms should dynamically adjust the transmission slots of the wireless interfaces (WIs). Such dynamic adjustment in transmission slots will result in improving the utilization of the wireless medium in a Wireless NoC (WiNoC). In this paper we present the design of two dynamic MAC mechanisms that adjust the transmission slots of the WIs based on predicted traffic demands and allow partial packet transfer. Through system level simulations, we demonstrate that the traffic aware MAC mechanisms are more energy efficient as well as capable of sustaining higher data bandwidth in WiNoCs.",

Therefore, yield of complex Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chips (MP-SoCs) will decrease due to higher probability of manufacturing defects especially, in dies with large area. Therefore, disintegration of large SoCs into smaller chips called chiplets will improve yield and cost of complex platform-based systems. This will also provide functional flexibility, modular scalability as well as the capability to integrate heterogeneous architectures and technologies in a single unit. However, with scaling of the number of chiplets in such a system, the shared resources in the system such as the interconnection fabric and memory modules will become performance bottlenecks. Additionally, the integration of heterogeneous chiplets operating at different frequencies and voltages can be challenging. State-of-the-art inter-chip communication requires power-hungry high-speed I/O circuits and data transfer over long wired traces on substrates. This increases energy consumption and latency while decreasing data bandwidth for chip-to-chip communication.

Existing WiNoC architectures generally use millimeter-wave antennas without significant directional gains, along with token passing protocol to access the shared wireless medium. This limits the achievable performance benefits since only one wireless pair can communicate at a time. It is also not practical in the immediate future to arbitrarily scale up the number of non-overlapping channels by designing transceivers operating in disjoint frequency bands in the millimeter-wave spectrum commonly adopted for on-chip wireless interconnects. Consequently, we explore the use of directional antennas whereby multiple wireless interconnect pairs can communicate simultaneously.

Wired interconnects through the fluidic layers is not possible, zig-zag antennas are implemented and placed in different configurations, to serve as wireless interconnects. The thermo-fluidic layers are modeled as channels of dielectric constant 1.75.

However, the increase in power density in 3D ICs due to reduced footprint aggravates the thermal issues in the chip. Liquid cooling through microfluidic channels can provide cooling capacities required for effective management of chip temperatures in 3D ICs. However, pumping liquid through the microchannels can cause high pressure drops causing structural instability in the chip. In order to reduce the pressure drops the height of the microchannels needs to be increased.

Token-based medium access mechanism is used in several WiNoC architectures to enable a distributed and optimal utilization of the available wireless bandwidth among multiple transmitters. Consequently, failure of the token passing mechanism can significantly degrade the potential benefits of this novel interconnect technology.

To enhance the performance of conventional interconnect-based multi-core chips, on-chip wireless interconnect has emerged as a radically different technology. However, this emerging interconnect paradigm imposes significant challenges pertaining to reliable integration and design. In this paper, we focus on two types of mm-wave wireless NoC architectures. One is a hierarchical architecture with long-range wireless shortcuts and the other is a power-law connectivity based small-world network without any hierarchy. We demonstrate that though the hierarchical architecture offers more bandwidth with lower energy dissipation than the small-world-based counterpart, it has significantly more area overhead.

This limitation can be addressed by drawing inspiration from the evolution of natural complex networks, which offer great performance-cost trade-offs.

Historically undesirable outcomes demonstrate the need to improve the management approach of MT. It is clear that evidence-based guidelines and protocols should be developed with the aim of improving MT-outcome.Methods: We implemented an evidence-based MT-Protocol (MTP) in 2007 and studied all patients (105) from Jan 2008 to Jan 2011 who required MT and were treated with the MTP at our institution. The MTP includes two phases and incorporates a fixed volume of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and platelets in addition to Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC).Results: The median age of patients was 57 years (range, 18-86). The male to female ratio was 74: 31. Median Hb was 90 g/L (range, 44-110) and platelet count was 190/nl (range, 34-817). Thirteen patients developed mild DIC; 22 moderate DIC and one severe DIC. D-dimer showed average increase of 7.9 mg/L with a range between 0.6-35 mg/L (Normal< 0.5). Average INR was 1.97,(range, 1.2-7.2), while average APTT was 36 seconds (range, 22-88s). The mortality rate was 11.4%(12/105) and these were mainly related to underlying trauma rather than DIC with the exception of 1 patient. The average number of transfused PRBC was 15 units (range, 6-42); cryoprecipitate, 20 (range, 10-60); platelets, 2 (range, 1-7) and FFP, 8 (range, 2-20).Conclusion: Despite serious bleeding secondary to trauma or surgery, the implementation of MTP seems to have reduced the\u00a0\u2026",

Such faults include crosstalk, faults in the buffers of NoC routers, and higher-level faults such as packet mis-routing and data scrambling [2]. These fault types add to the classic faults that must be tested postfabrication for all integrated circuits (stuck-at, opens, shorts, memory faults, etc.).

The conventional two-dimensional (2D) copper-based IC has inherent limitations due to the geometrical constraints of the planar structure. Innovative interconnect paradigms based on optical technologies, RF/wireless, carbon nanotubes, or 3D integration are promising alternatives that may indeed overcome the challenges encountered. In this paper we present an overview of different emerging non-traditional approaches to achieve massive degree of integration in a single chip. The advantages and underlying challenges of each method are highlighted.",

With this ever increasing degree of integration, design of communication architectures for large, multi-core SoCs is a challenge. Traditional bus-based systems will no longer be able to meet the clock cycle requirements of these big SoCs. Instead, the communication requirements of these large multi processor SoCs (MP-SoCs) are convened by the emerging network-on-chip (NoC) paradigm. Crosstalk between adjacent wires is an important signal integrity issue in NoC communication fabrics and it can cause timing violations and extra energy dissipation. Crosstalk avoidance codes (CACs) can be used to improve the signal integrity by reducing the effective coupling capacitance, lowering the energy dissipation of wire segments. As\u00a0\u2026",

To fully exploit the performance benefits of 3D architectures, it is imperative to address signal integrity issues in the design phase and its implications on energy dissipation. In this work we show that by incorporating joint crosstalk avoidance and multiple error correction schemes it is possible to enhance the robustness and reduce the energy dissipation simultaneously for both the 3D and more conventional planar NoC architectures. The achievable energy savings in 3D NoCs is significantly more than that in 2D structures.",

The widespread adoption and deployment of the NoC paradigm will only be possible if it inherently addresses system level signal integrity and reliability issues in addition to easing the design process. In order to protect the NoC interconnect infrastructures against different transient malfunctions, we propose to modify the data packets with joint crosstalk avoidance and double error correction codes.

However, the consumer-grade mmWave routers suffer from coarse-grained channel state information due to cost-effective antenna array design limiting the accuracy of localization systems. To address these challenges, we present a Machine Learning (ML) and Kalman Filter (KF) integrated localization system (KF-Loc). The ML model learns the complex wireless features for predicting the static position of the robot.

        "description": "Summary form only given, as follows. A record of the panel discussions was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The growing performance needs of modern data-driven applications related to the Internet-of-Things (IoT), Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) result in demand for increasingly higher levels of computational complexity, storage capacity, and communication performance in computing devices. Therefore, to meet the proliferating demands for computing without overshooting the global energy budget, scaling up the performance of the future computing systems with significant improvement in their energy-efficiency is of paramount importance. However, the computing industry will no longer be able to scale up computing capability and energy-efficiency using the basic approach of scaling down the transistor feature sizes or improving the bandwidth of conventional\u00a0\u2026"
