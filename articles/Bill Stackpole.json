These risk discovery and analyses practices are commonly known as penetration tests (pentests), and have emerged as requirement for most organizations under many compliance regimes such as the global Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and the federal Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) in the United States. Though a growing body of research addresses the utility of pentests as a valuable Business Intelligence method, pentest outputs are not standardized and require time-consuming generation and ingestion before they can provide inputs to Business Intelligence Systems. In this study, we examined several pentest reports and propose a standardized schema for output generation in a common format that is easy for Business Intelligence Systems to\u00a0\u2026"

As devices become more ubiquitous and users place more sensitive data on their devices, the amount of mobile malware in the wild has grown. In order to protect mobile device users and their data, mobile security solutions have been brought to market for consumer and enterprise users. The limited success observed in protecting devices so far warrants a redoubled effort to develop effective mobile device security solutions. The research presented in this paper represents the ongoing result of malware analysis for the Android platform by combining code review and behavioral testing. The data collected from these processes suggests the need to implement several security techniques not currently found in Android. To the benefit of users and developers, most of these techniques are coded into Android and provide comprehensive protection\u00a0\u2026",

Smartphones are subject to traditional computer network covert channel techniques. Smartphones also introduce new sets of covert channel techniques as they add more capabilities and multiple network connections. This work presents a new network covert channel in smartphones. The research studies the ability to leak information from the smartphones applications by reaching the cellular voice stream, and it examines the ability to employ the cellular voice channel to be a potential medium of information leakage through carrying modulated speech-like data covertly. To validate the theory, an Android software audio modem has been developed and it was able to leak data successfully through the cellular voice channel stream by carrying modulated data with a throughput of 13 bps with 0.018% BER. Moreover, Android security policies are investigated and broken in order to implement a user-mode rootkit that opens the voice channels by stealthily answering an incoming voice call. Multiple scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed covert channel. This study identifies a new potential smartphone covert channel, and discusses some security vulnerabilities in Android OS that allow the use of this channel demonstrating the need to set countermeasures against this kind of breach.",

When attempting to detect malware within a device, it is difficult to draw a clear line between malicious and normal activities. Even useful applications naturally result in data transfer from a mobile device to a remote server and a malware detection mechanism based solely on information flow might consider this as data leakage. Therefore one should also consider the surrounding context of an application to make a better decision on whether it is malicious or not. In this current research, a dynamic analysis approach is taken which monitors and measures the runtime behavior and logs from the mobile application. In particular, a concept of user awareness (UA) is proposed which represents a degree of intent with which an application tries to hide its activities from a user.

Solutions to overcome looping frames are addressed by special protocols at layer 2, which block ports in the bridges to build a logical spanning tree for frame forwarding. However, due to the continuing convergence issues in the Spanning Tree algorithm, IETF RFC 5556 Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links on RBridges (router bridges) and IEEE 802.1 aqShortest Path Bridging both use link state routing techniques to build Dijkstra trees from every switch. Both techniques have the expense of higher processing complexity. In this paper, a novel meshed tree algorithm (MTA) is investigated to address convergence issues faced by STA while also avoiding the complexity of Link State routing. The MTA based protocol is compared with Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol using OPNET simulations. The significant reduction in convergence time combined with the simplicity in implementation indicates that the Meshed Tree Protocol would be superior candidate to resolve looping issues in switched networks.",

        "description": "Loop free frame forwarding in layer 2 switched networks that use meshed topologies to provision for link and path redundancy is a continuing challenge. The challenge is addressed through special protocols at layer 2 that build logical trees over the physically meshed topologies, along which frames can be forwarded. The first such protocol was based on the spanning tree. The spanning tree protocol (STP) had high convergence times subsequent to topology changes. Rapid STP and IETF RFC 5556 Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) on Router Bridges (RBridges) were then developed to reduce the convergence times. RSTP continued to use the spanning tree while TRILL adopted link state routing to support a tree from every switch. TRILL introduces high processing complexity into layer 2 networks. In this article a new meshed tree algorithm (MTA) and a loop avoidance protocol based on the MTA, namely the meshed tree protocol (MTP) are discussed. The MTA allows constructing several overlapping trees from a single root switch. This speeds up convergence to link failures. The MTP proposes a simple numbering scheme to implement meshed trees\u2013thus, the processing complexity is low. The specification for the MTP is currently an ongoing IEEE standard Project 1910.1. In this article the operational details of MTP are presented and its performance evaluated and compared with RSTP."

Alongside the growth of the operating system, malware for Android has increased tremendously. Currently, few strategies are available to identify and detect malware on this platform. Users are generally na\u00efve and are fooled into downloading apps, which may be harmful or malicious. They do not have enough experience with either the platform or the apps to know what can be malicious and what is genuine. Thus, the goal of the authors is to create a series of interactive labs that instruct students with little experience with the Android platform or dynamic malware analysis techniques in the methods of dynamic malware analysis and dynamic malware analysis tools for the Android operating system."

To combat this, it is vital that the security field devote research into finding better methods of malware analysis and subsequently malware defense. As a result, initiative was taken to perform focused research on this subject in the form of an independent study. The purpose of the study is to develop a lab virtual environment for analyzing Android malware. The solution needs to be intuitive and centrally managed in order to be effective for a professor and their assistants. Work has begun on such a system, and the plan is to continue developing an environment until an adequate solution has been produced.",

We are committed to making sure that the competitions are well supported and continue to improve. We also realized that our past system of basically having each hosting institution essentially build the competition from scratch does not contribute to keeping the competition of high quality and improving.

It allows enterprises to grow and be managed more efficiently and with less dependence on specific hardware platforms. At the same time, complexities and changes such as those represented by virtualization constitute disruptive technologies requiring careful attention to ensure that systems continue to operate as expected. There are several options available when deploying these technologies; one that deserves significant consideration is the virtualization cluster.This paper will document the rationale, design, selection, and construction process involved in creating such a virtualization cluster. The efforts documented in this paper have shown that, with minimal funding, any educational institution can construct and provide a hands-on virtualization cluster environment to help teach students about virtualization and provide opportunities for undergraduate and faculty research. One can affordably build a sufficiently powerful environment using Commercial-Offthe-Shelf (COTS) components. A locally available virtualization cluster can enhance student success by providing hands-on access helping them to grasp the concepts and prepare them to make use of the technology. It may also servers to facilitate experimentation with many aspects of systems administration and security.",

Because of this, developers of mobile operating systems have built in configuration options to these operating systems to better protect the device from security vulnerabilities. However, not all of these operating systems have such settings turned on when the device is pulled out of the box. Furthermore, not all users are aware of how to best protect their information, nor the kind of issues that should be considered when owning and using these devices.

The strength of current PII tools is to quickly find possible PII in locations in which data are visible to the operating system. However, they do not provide support for searching data outside of these traditional areas. For example, if a file containing the same string of 16 digits had been deleted, the current PII tools would not find the file even though it may be recoverable.

It must be able to accommodate changes in cryptographic technology  as well as the international restrictions on cryptographic use. Second, the architecture  must support all the client IP protocols (i.e., Transmission Control Protocol or TCP, User  Datagram Protocol or UDP) in standard or cast (i.e., multicast) modes. Third, it must be  able to secure communications between two hosts or multiple hosts, two subnets or  multiple subnets, or a combination of hosts and subnets.

One would not build a new home and wait until it is completed to think about adding a security system. The security system would be an integral part of the design. One would not buy windows without latches or doors without locks. Yet often this is exactly what is done with networks. Applications, operating systems, and servers are bought with inadequate security. Then after reading a few Internet horror stories, one decides he or she is living in a really bad neighborhood and tries to fit security into the system. A firewall (or some other security device) is purchased with the idea that it resolves the problem - but it does not! In reality all that has been created is a false sense of security.

The challenge is addressed through special protocols at layer 2 that build logical trees over the physically meshed topologies, along which frames can be forwarded. The first such protocol was based on the spanning tree. The spanning tree protocol (STP) had high convergence times subsequent to topology changes. Rapid STP and IETF RFC 5556 Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) on Router Bridges (RBridges) were then developed to reduce the convergence times. RSTP continued to use the spanning tree while TRILL adopted link state routing to support a tree from every switch. TRILL introduces high processing complexity into layer 2 networks.
