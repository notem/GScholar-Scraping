We focus particularly on the nature of all deductive methods as procedures to derive, within a formal system for the representation of declarative statements and their relations, valid conclusions from valid premises. We stress that, despite connotations suggested by its name and of much confusion in the literature, the deductive methods of fuzzy reasoning are sound, rational procedures rather than mere heuristic approximations of the classical inferential procedures of two-valued logic."

Black-box attacks are especially dangerous, as they only require the attacker to have the ability to query the target model and observe the labels it returns, without knowing anything else about the model. Current black-box attacks either have low success rates, require a high number of queries, produce adversarial images that are easily distinguishable from their sources, or are not flexible in controlling the outcome of the attack. In this paper, we present AdversarialPSO, (Code available: https://github.com/rhm6501/AdversarialPSOImages) a black-box attack that uses few queries to create adversarial examples with high success rates.

        "description": "Machine learning models have been found to be susceptible to adversarial examples that are often indistinguishable from the original inputs. These adversarial examples are created by applying adversarial perturbations to input samples, which would cause them to be misclassified by the target models. Attacks that search and apply the perturbations to create adversarial examples are performed in both white-box and black-box settings, depending on the information available to the attacker about the target. For black-box attacks, the only capability available to the attacker is the ability to query the target with specially crafted inputs and observing the labels returned by the model. Current black-box attacks either have low success rates, requires a high number of queries, or produce adversarial examples that are easily distinguishable from their sources. In this paper, we present AdversarialPSO, a black-box attack that uses fewer queries to create adversarial examples with high success rates. AdversarialPSO is based on the evolutionary search algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization, a populationbased gradient-free optimization algorithm. It is flexible in balancing the number of queries submitted to the target vs the quality of imperceptible adversarial examples. The attack has been evaluated using the image classification benchmark datasets CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Imagenet, achieving success rates of 99.6%, 96.3%, and 82.0%, respectively, while submitting substantially fewer queries than the state-of-the-art.

Various techniques including sampling and cost sensitive learning are often employed to improve the performance of classifiers in such situations. However, the training process of classifiers is still largely driven by traditional error based objective functions. As a result, there is clearly a gap between themeasure according to which the classifier is evaluated and how the classifier is trained. This paper investigates the prospect of explicitly using the appropriate measure itself to search the hypothesis space to bridge this gap. In the case studies, a standard threelayer neural network is used as the classifier, which is evolved by genetic algorithms (GAs) with G-mean as the objective function. Experimental\u00a0\u2026",

In this paper, we expound upon previous work done with timing channels and apply it to detecting covert storage channels. Our approach is based on the assumption that the entropy of covert channels will vary from that of previously observed, legitimate, communications. This change in the entropy of a process provides us with a method for identifying storage channels. Using this assumption we created proof of concept code capable of detecting various covert storage channels.

There is a long history of using various board games as methods of covert communication, from what we could call \u201cdifferential\u201d communication (ie the movement of pieces constitutes the \u201clanguage\u201d) to the idea of \u201cgame state\u201d communication (where the current state of all the manipulatable objects in the game world represents a message). For many years we have seen covert channels in games like chess, checkers and other simple board games and even evolution to more \u201ccomplex\u201d computer games like magnetron.

Unlike typical methods of audio steganography that propose storage by modifying the least significant bits or the phase of the audio data, this approach makes use of frequency ranges that are undetectable to the human ear. The method proposed in this paper provides for a reasonably high-bandwidth and is resistant to common detection and prevention techniques.",

For spies and terrorist cells, this quality can be the difference between life and death. However, even the detection of communications in a botnet could be troublesome for its creators. To evade detection and prevent insights into the size and members of a botnet, covert channels can be used. A botnet should rely on covert channels built on ubiquitous protocols to blend in with legitimate traffic. In this paper, we propose a covert channel built on the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol. In a simple application, this covert channel can be used to discretely and covertly send messages between two parties. However, this covert channel can also be used to stealthily distribute commands or the location of a command and control server for use in a botnet.",

With the vast amount of traffic on the internet, network protocols have become a common vehicle for covert channels, typically hiding information in the header fields of packets. Domain name service (DNS) packets contain a 32-bit time to live (TTL) fields for each response record. This is the number of seconds the entry is valid for before caching servers remove the entry.

This paper sets out to contribute to this field by introducing a new covert channel which operates over transport layer protocols.

In addition, this paper proposes a number of encoding schemes which can be used in conjunction with this channel to improve its bandwidth and covertness.",

Expressions are segmented into connected components, and then components in the query expression and each expression in the collection are matched using contour and density features, aspect ratios, and relative positions.

This method requires a trusted third party to verify identifies, which does not play well with independent knowledge based systems, especially in the case of autonomous agents. In this paper, we proposes an asymptotic secrecy model to secure communications between and within knowledge based systems over public channels. The new model assumes that adversaries are storage space bounded, but not computationally bounded.

On the one hand, this covert channel, if used properly, can potentially enhance the overall security of data communications over networks. On the other hand, the covert channel can also potentially become a back door to access a destination computer, and hence becomes a security hazard to the computer. A simple protocol is specified for communications on the covert channel. A modified TFTP application is also presented to demonstrate how to use the covert channel to convey secret messages or to enhance the integrity of data communications. The application also illustrates a back door that leaks client\u2019s data files without user notification. A sliding entropy method is also introduced to detect some cases of covert channels.",

A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are important in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal\u00a0\u2026",

The number of products on the market that contain technology based on fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory is rapidly increasing. Apparently, most applications using fuzzy controllers are more successful than those cameras. Therefore, the appearance of an introductory book such as this, on fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory, is timely. In the introduction, the authors explain how the notion of fuzziness relates to the uncertainty of measurements and the vagueness of natural language, and they distinguish fuzziness from probability. The next two chapters briefly cover classical logic and set theory. While logical quantifiers are introduced, logical inference is explained only for propositional logic, and the treatment of set theory does not go much beyond Venn diagrams\u00a0\u2026",

In this paper, considering that the primary aim of hardware implementation is the realization of high speed processing, we introduce a look-up table approach, which can realize high speed fuzzy-logic inference.",

This problem has a broad applicability, even though it emerged in the context of a particular engineering application\u2014the process of manufacturing electric circuit boards. Two distinct approaches are used for dealing with the problem, each resulting in a particular algorithm. Both algorithms employ evolutionary computation. The first approach is based on the well-known fuzzy c-means algorithm. The principal idea is that we use the full class of Mahalanobis distances, each of which weights the variables involved in a particular way. Using this class of distances, we search by an evolutionary algorithm for the optimal distance\u2014one under which the fuzzy c-means algorithm produces a fuzzy partition of the given data set that is\u00a0\u2026",

While the previous book focuses on theoretical foundations of rough set theory, this book deals with the most rccent developments and successful applications.Rough set theory is one of currently active research areas dealing with uncertain and imprecise knowledge. The concept of a rough set was first introduced by Pawlak [1982]. However, the idea of a rough set was already presented in 1976 in Shafer's book on evidence theory [Shafer, 19761. In general, a rough set is an imprecise representation of a given set, either crisp or fuzzy, by a lower and upper approximations in terms of equivalence classes that are induced from an equivalence\u00a0\u2026"

This approach, which is based on the application of an evolutionary strategy to the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, utilizes the relationship between the various definitions of distance and structures implied in each given data set. As soon as a particular definition of distance is chosen, a particular structure in the data set is implied. Therefore, the search for a structure in given data can be viewed as a search for an appropriate definition of distance. We describe an evolutionary algorithm for determining the \"best\" distance for given data, where the criterion of goodness is defined in terms of the performance of the fuzzy c-means clustering method. We discuss relevant theoretical aspects as well as experimental results that characterize the utility of the proposed algorithm.< >",

It seems a disadvantage of applying it. However, in this paper, we show that we can make modus ponens satisfied by slightly modifying the original IF-THEN rules in the rule base. That is, we can obtain an approximation of the original rules on which modus ponens holds. The related concepts such as MP approximations and invariant MP approximations are introduced. Their properties are investigated. The second issue of this paper is about the invariance of rule adding of a rule base. It is found that in some cases, the function of a rule base is not changed by adding a new rule into the base which is obtained from the base. The relationships between the invariant MP approximation and the invariance of rule addi\u0144g are investigated.",

        "description": "Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic is a true magnum opus. An enlargement of Fuzzy Sets, Uncertainty, and Information-an earlier work of Professor Klir and Tina Folger-Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic addresses practically every significant topic in the broad expanse of the union of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. To me Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic is a remarkable achievement; it covers its vast territory with impeccable authority, deep insight and a meticulous attention to detail. To view Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic in a proper perspective, it is necessary to clarify a point of semantics which relates to the meanings of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. A frequent source of misunderstanding fins to do with the interpretation of fuzzy logic. The problem is that the term fuzzy logic has two different meanings. More specifically, in a narrow sense, fuzzy logic, FLn, is a logical system which may be viewed as an extension and generalization of classical multivalued logics. But in a wider sense, fuzzy logic, FL, is almost synonymous with the theory of fuzzy sets. In this context, what is important t& recognize is that (a) FLw is much broader than FL, and subsumes FL, as one of its branches;(b) the agenda of FLn is very different from the agendas of classical multivalued logics; and (c) at this juncture, the term fuzzy logic is usually used in its wide rather than narrow sense, effectively equating fuzzy logic with FLT,, In Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic, fuzzy logic is interpreted in a sense that is close to FLw. However, to avoid misunderstanding, the title refers to both fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. Underlying the organization of Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic is a fundamental fact, namely, that any field\u00a0\u2026",

Taken together, these two facts constitute a paradox. A second paradox is that almost all of the successful fuzzy logic applications are embedded controllers, while most of the theoretical papers on fuzzy methods deal with knowledge representation and reasoning. I hope to resolve these paradoxes by identifying which aspects of fuzzy logic render it useful in practice, and which aspects are inessential. My conclusions are based on a mathematical result, on a survey of literature on the use of fuzzy logic in heuristic control and in expert systems, and on practical experience in developing expert systems.< >",

We also show that our results generalize those presented for one-dimensional fuzzy relation equations (Nola et al., 1989).< >",
