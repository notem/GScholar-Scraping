When a network link or device fails, the tree must be repaired, leading to high convergence latencies impacting both broadcast and unicast traffic. Unicast frames are constrained to use the tree paths, which may not be the shortest path and links are not utilized uniformly. We propose a new meshed tree algorithm and meshed tree protocol (MTP) to provide non-looping paths (with backup) for broadcast frames. We also propose a new scheme for unicast frames to use shortest paths (provisioned with backup) between end devices. A novel virtual ID technique to construct the trees makes the protocol robust and provides fast failure recovery.

The booths in exhibition halls are arranged and changed frequently for different exhibitions, which means that the evacuation paths are not fixed. Most people are also unfamiliar with the exhibition hall environment. In case of fire, earthquake, or other emergencies, people need to quickly escape to the safety exit, adhering to the guidance of evacuation signage. Existing evacuation signs are located according to the standards and the experience of the designers, and the locations of the signs are fixed and do not change with the changes in the booth layout, which means that the signage can be easily obscured by the booths, affecting the signage identification. Based on the visibility of evacuation signage, a smart design method of evacuation signage layout is proposed in this paper that can be adapted to different forms of booth arrangements in exhibition halls. This method establishes a key goal of achieving the full coverage of the visibility range of evacuation passages with the minimum number of evacuation signs. In the context of the actual visibility range of evacuation signage being blocked by booths in a three-dimensional space, this method finds the optimal number and best locations of evacuation signs by using a genetic algorithm. Finally, a case is given to verify the effectiveness of the method. This smart design for evacuation signage layout can enhance the guidance ability of evacuation signage in exhibition halls and improve the efficiency of evacuation.",

In seismically active regions of Southwest China, local rural residents' dilapidated housing with poor seismic performance aggravates the impacts of earthquakes on their mental health. These residents' mental health is difficult to recognize because of the lack of appropriate assessment methods. In addition, rural residents in the area have a low socioeconomic status and cannot access adequate mental treatment. Thus, telemedicine could be an effective approach to assist mental health practice in such areas. However, the lack of telemedicine assessment factors in these areas makes it difficult to complete the correct triage and prioritization of rural residents' mental health quickly and effectively. To provide a foundation for applying telemedicine to assess the risk of mental health problems that rural residents in seismically active regions experience, this paper studied whether the degree of safety of housing can affect mental health. In this study, nine villages near the epicenter of the 2019 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Changning County, China were randomly selected, and 162 valid questionnaires were completed. SPSS statistical software was used to analyze the collected data. First, the satisfaction of rural residents with the degree of safety of housing significantly affected the K6 score and whether they suffered from mental problems. Second, the mental health of rural residents living in reinforced concrete frame structure housing was obviously superior to that of those living in other types of housing. Next, the most significant factor affecting mental health was the degree of wall\u00a0\u2026",

We propose the Meshed Tree Protocol (MTP) to designate the number of roots based on desired network uptime and computational overhead, where a meshed tree conceptually maintains multiple tree branches from a root.

Black-box attacks are especially dangerous, as they only require the attacker to have the ability to query the target model and observe the labels it returns, without knowing anything else about the model. Current black-box attacks either have low success rates, require a high number of queries, produce adversarial images that are easily distinguishable from their sources, or are not flexible in controlling the outcome of the attack.

        "description": "Machine learning models have been found to be susceptible to adversarial examples that are often indistinguishable from the original inputs. These adversarial examples are created by applying adversarial perturbations to input samples, which would cause them to be misclassified by the target models. Attacks that search and apply the perturbations to create adversarial examples are performed in both white-box and black-box settings, depending on the information available to the attacker about the target. For black-box attacks, the only capability available to the attacker is the ability to query the target with specially crafted inputs and observing the labels returned by the model. Current black-box attacks either have low success rates, requires a high number of queries, or produce adversarial examples that are easily distinguishable from their sources. In this paper, we present AdversarialPSO, a black-box attack that uses fewer queries to create adversarial examples with high success rates. AdversarialPSO is based on the evolutionary search algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization, a populationbased gradient-free optimization algorithm. It is flexible in balancing the number of queries submitted to the target vs the quality of imperceptible adversarial examples. The attack has been evaluated using the image classification benchmark datasets CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Imagenet, achieving success rates of 99.6%, 96.3%, and 82.0%, respectively, while submitting substantially fewer queries than the state-of-the-art.

Traditional signature-based detection is no longer adequate to detect new variants and highly targeted malware. Furthermore, dynamic detection is often circumvented with anti-VM and/or anti-debugger techniques. Recently heuristic approaches have been explored to enhance detection accuracy while maintaining the generality of a model to detect unknown malware samples. In this paper, we investigate three feature types extracted from memory images - registry activity, imported libraries, and API function calls. After evaluating the importance of the different features, different machine learning techniques are implemented to compare performances of malware detection using the three feature types, respectively. The highest accuracy achieved was 96%, and was reached using a support vector machine model, fitted on data\u00a0\u2026",

Through the analysis of 139 valid questionnaires which have at least one social network sites account, we draw some interesting conclusions. Honesty confirmation of self-disclosure has a positive relationship with the three dimension of perceived social capital but not the users\u2019 satisfaction. Perceived social network is a significant antecedent of users\u2019 satisfaction and continuance intention on account of the high switching cost.

By integrating Communication Privacy Management Theory, Disclosure Decision Model and Social Capital Theory, we propose a SNS user self-disclosure model. In particular, we propose that perceived privacy risk (PPR) and perceived information control ability (PICA) are the two key antecedents of user self-disclosure. We further suggest that that the three dimensions of social capital, namely, relational dimension, cognitive dimension, and structural dimension, influence PPR and PICA respectively. A survey was conducted and structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. Our hypotheses are generally supported. Research implications are discussed.",

        "description": "There are numerous challenges in ensuring secure communications within modern Wireless Sensor Networks. In particular, valid node identification in sensor networks is a crucial aspect of maintaining data confidentiality and nonrepudiation. Statically-assigned identities provide simple capabilities, but they also allow attackers to easily predict IDs\u2014thus creating a susceptibility to sensor impersonation attacks. Dynamic identities, however, can allow for uses beyond that of a simple name for a device. This work focuses on proposing a solution that not only allows for dynamicallyassigned node identities within a network, but also for defense-in-depth capabilities when used in conjunction with a security scheme."

For example, the tools might search for files that contain strings of 16 digits that could represent a credit card number. The strength of current PII tools is to quickly find possible PII in locations in which data are visible to the operating system. However, they do not provide support for searching data outside of these traditional areas. For example, if a file containing the same string of 16 digits had been deleted, the current PII tools would not find the file even though it may be recoverable. Deleted files are considered unallocated and are not available to view by PII tools.",

The proposed scheme uses a hybrid approach, where the proactive MMT is used for intra cluster routing while a reactive MMT (RMMT) introduced in this article is used for inter cluster routing. We further propose a novel route discovery and route recording scheme using route request and route response messages but has low flooding overheads and exhibits high route stability under high node mobility conditions. We apply the proposed RMMT scheme to provide connectivity among moving teams of ground troops and present simulation results\u00a0\u2026",

In this work, we are interested in QoS provisioning in Internet connected MANETs- which are expected to support users roaming in from cellular or WLANs with an active call.

Many of these advances have also provided malicious users with the ability to conceal their activities and destroy evidence of their actions. This has raised the need of developing specialists in computer digital forensics -- the preservation, identification, extraction and documentation of evidence stored in the form of digitally encoded information (data).In this paper, we present the procedures and rationale used in the development of forensic courses at both the undergraduate and the graduate levels. We also demonstrate our decision making process of selecting topics included in each course.",

        "description": "In this paper, I continue to study the alternative hierarchical analysis method that was initialed in [Saaty, 1976]. Instead of using pairwise ratio matrices, this method uses pairwise subtraction matrices. By doing so, computational complexity is reduced significantly, and as shown by a statistical experiment described in this paper, the two methods lead basically to the same results. Furthermore, this method provides an optimal solution in the sense of minimizing an appropriate error function. Due to the significant reduction in computational complexity, fuzzy hierarchical analysis based on pairwise subtraction matrices becomes more manageable. Finally, I point out a new application area of the hierarchical analysis: estimating crisp or fuzzy prior probability distributions for Bayesian inference with imprecise probabilities.",

It has increasingly been recognized that this requirement is often not realistic. To overcome this limitation of classical Bayesian inference, we investigate a generalized Bayesian inference, in which prior probabilities as well as likelihoods are interval-valued. Employing the tools of interval analysis and the theory of imprecise probabilities, we develop a method for exact calculation of interval-valued posterior probabilities for given interval-valued prior probabilities and precise or interval-valued likelihoods. This method is further generalized for fuzzy likelihood and fuzzy probabilities later. The classical Bayesian inference is a special case of our method.",

It seems a disadvantage of applying it. However, in this paper, we show that we can make modus ponens satisfied by slightly modifying the original IF-THEN rules in the rule base. That is, we can obtain an approximation of the original rules on which modus ponens holds. The related concepts such as MP approximations and invariant MP approximations are introduced. Their properties are investigated. The second issue of this paper is about the invariance of rule adding of a rule base. It is found that in some cases, the function of a rule base is not changed by adding a new rule into the base which is obtained from the base. The relationships between the invariant MP approximation and the invariance of rule addi\u0144g are investigated.",

Interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS) based approximate reasoning is also studied. The generalized compositional rule of inference (GCRI) is applied into interval-valued reasoning. It is proved that Modus Ponens and Syllogism hold for IVFS based GCRI, and we conclude that using GCRI with respect to the g-family is quite reasonable for IVFS based approximate reasoning.",
