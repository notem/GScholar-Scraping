        "description": "Cookies provide a state management mechanism for the web and are often used for authentication, storing a user's session ID, and replacing their credentials in subsequent requests. These ``session cookies'' are valuable targets of attacks such as Session Hijacking and Fixation that attempt to steal them and gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Multiple controls such as the Secure and HttpOnly cookie attributes restrict cookie accessibility, effectively mitigating attacks from the network or malicious websites, but often ignoring untrusted extensions within the user's browser. Extensions are third-party HTML/JavaScript add-ons with access to several privileged APIs and can run on multiple websites at once. Unfortunately, this can provide malicious/compromised extensions with unrestricted access to session cookies. In this work, we first conduct a study assessing the prevalence of extensions with these ``risky'' APIs (i.e., those enabling cookie modification and theft) and find that they are currently used by hundreds of millions of users. Motivated by this, we propose browser controls based on two new cookie attributes that protect cookies from malicious extensions: BrowserOnly and Tracked. The BrowserOnly attribute prevents accessing cookies from extensions altogether. While effective, not all cookies can be inaccessible. Cookies with the Tracked attribute remain accessible, are tied to a single browser, and record any modifications made by extensions. Thus, stolen Tracked cookies become unusable outside their original browser and servers can verify any modifications. To demonstrate these features' practicality, we implement CREAM\u00a0\u2026"

        "description": "The rise in IoT-driven distributed data analytics, coupled with increasing privacy concerns, has led to a demand for effective privacy-preserving and federated data collection/model training mechanisms. In response, approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been proposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they still share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks wherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. poisoned) data to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results. In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for IoT/embedded devices' software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity security features of embedded devices - in particular ARM TrustZoneM security extensions - to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases SLAPP's security and low overhead."

        "description": "Micro-controller units (MCUs) implement the de facto interface between the physical and digital worlds. As a consequence, they appear in a variety of sensing/actuation applications, from smart personal spaces to complex industrial control systems and safety-critical medical equipment. While many of these devices perform safety- and time-critical tasks, they often lack support for security features compatible with their importance to overall system functions. This lack of architectural support leaves them vulnerable to run-time attacks that can remotely alter their intended behavior, with potentially catastrophic consequences. In particular, we note that MCU software often includes untrusted third-party libraries (some of them closed-source) that are blindly used within MCU programs, without proper isolation from the rest of the system. In turn, a single vulnerability (or intentional backdoor) in one such third-party software can often compromise the entire MCU software state. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing, demonstrating security, and formally verifying the implementation of UCCA: an Untrusted Code Compartment Architecture. UCCA provides flexible hardware-enforced isolation of untrusted code sections (e.g., third-party software modules) in resource-constrained and time-critical MCUs. To demonstrate UCCA's practicality, we implement an open-source version of the design on a real resource-constrained MCU: the well-known TI MSP430. Our evaluation shows that UCCA incurs little overhead and is affordable even to lowest-end MCUs, requiring significantly less overhead and assumptions than prior related work."

Such RoTs operate reactively: they can prove whether a desired action (eg, software update or program execution) was performed on a specific device.

        "description": "Much attention has been devoted to verifying software integrity of remote embedded (IoT) devices. Many techniques, with different assumptions and security guarantees, have been proposed under the common umbrella of so-called Remote Attestation (RA). Aside from executable's integrity verification, RA serves as a foundation for many security services, such as proofs of memory erasure, system reset, software update, and verification of runtime properties. Prior RA techniques verify the remote device's binary at the time when RA functionality is executed, thus providing no information about the device's binary before current RA execution or between consecutive RA executions. This implies that presence of transient malware (in the form of modified binary) may be undetected. In other words, if transient malware infects a device (by modifying its binary), performs its nefarious tasks, and erases itself before the next\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "Modern society is increasingly surrounded by, and is growing accustomed to, a wide range of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), and smart devices. They often perform safety-critical functions, e.g., personal medical devices, automotive CPS as well as industrial and residential automation (such as sensor-alarm combinations). On the lower end of the scale, these devices are small, cheap, and specialized sensors and/or actuators. They tend to host small CPUs, have small amounts of memory, and run simple software. If such devices are left unprotected, consequences of forged sensor readings or ignored actuation commands can be catastrophic, particularly, in safety-critical settings. This prompts the following questions: (1) How to trust data produced, or guarantee that actions will be performed, by a simple remote embedded device?, (2) How to bind actions and results to the execution of expected software? and, (3) Can (1) and (2) be attained even if all software on a device can be modified and/or compromised (e.g., by malware) at any given time?This dissertation presents a set of hardware/software co-designs for obtaining several security services \u2013 namely remote attestation, TOCTOU-avoidance, proofs of execution, and root of trust availability \u2013 which can be used to assure the integrity and availability of software and its execution, even on some of the most resource-constrained micro-controllers.

RA is particularly relevant to safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS) where a set of low-end micro-controllers (MCUs), operate under the control of a remote and more powerful controller. In such cases, RA is an effective and relatively efficient means to detect software compromise, e.g., malware infections, on these low-end MCUs that cannot support expensive security mechanisms. Unfortunately, current RA techniques have a major practical limitation by requiring one or more of: (i) customized hardware support on every Prv; or (ii) physical presence of Vrf, which must be directly connected to all Prv-s, or (iii) secure pre-loading of trusted software.

Prominent examples of such architectures are Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). A typical TEE relies on a dynamic Root of Trust (RoT) to provide security services such as code/data confidentiality and integrity, isolated secure software execution, remote attestation, and sensor auditing. Despite their usefulness, there is currently no secure means to determine whether a given security service or task is being performed by the particular RoT within a specific physical device. We refer to this as the Root of Trust Identification (RTI) problem and discuss how it inhibits security for applications such as sensing and actuation. We formalize the RTI problem and argue that security of RTI protocols is especially challenging\u00a0\u2026",

In turn, PoX can be implemented very efficiently and securely in low-end MCU-s. Consequently, our design achieves the lowest hardware overhead of any CFA architecture (i.e., two orders of magnitude cheaper), while relying on a formally verified PoX architecture as its sole hardware requirement. With respect to runtime overhead, Tiny-CFA also achieves better performance than prior CFA techniques based on code instrumentation. We implement and evaluate Tiny-CFA, analyze its security, and demonstrate its practicality using real-world publicly available applications.",

We leverage and describe four spatial and social properties and characterize them in a real-world dataset. As a proof of concept of employing those properties, we propose SAMPLER, a forwarding algorithm that combines social awareness, points of interest within a region, and users' individual mobility patterns to cost-effectively deliver messages in opportunistic device-to-device networks.

A fundamental problem in multi-hop D2D networks is the design of forwarding algorithms that achieve, at the same time, high delivery ratio and low network overhead. In this work, we study group meetings\u2019 properties by looking at their structure and regularity with the goal of applying such knowledge in the design of a forwarding algorithm for D2D multi-hop networks. We introduce a forwarding protocol, namely GROUPS-NET, which is aware of social group meetings and their evolution over time. Our algorithm is parameter-calibration free and does not require any knowledge about the social network structure of the system. In particular, different from the state of the art algorithms, GROUPS-NET does not need communities\u2019 detection, which is a complex and expensive task\u00a0\u2026",

We show that existing mobility models for humans do not capture the regularity of human group meetings present in real mobility traces. We characterize the statistical properties of such group meetings in real mobility traces and design GRM accordingly. We show that GRM maintains the typical pairwise contact properties of real traces, such as contact duration and inter-contact time distributions. In addition, GRM accounts for the role of group mobility, presenting group meetings regularity and social communities' structure. Finally, we evaluate state-of-art social-aware protocols for opportunistic routing and show that their performance in synthetic traces generated by GRM is similar to their performance in real-world traces.",

Legacy authentication and access control mechanisms do not meet the growing needs of IoT. In particular, there is a dire need for a holistic authentication mechanism throughout the IoT device life-cycle, namely from the manufacturing to the retirement of the device. As a plausible solution, we present Authentication of Things (AoT), a suite of protocols that incorporate authentication and access control during the entire IoT device life span.

In our previous work, we proposed a multi-layered control strategy for the robot soccer team deployment. In the initial version we had three layers. The highest layer corresponded to the decisor of the soccer strategies (eg, dribble, pass, shoot). The middle control layer used a video camera, as feedback, to capture positions and angles and Lyapunov multi-variable control to set robots trajectories. The lowest level of control implemented a PID controller to set the robot wheels velocity, using Arduino prototyping platform to control and optical encoders as feedback. In the present work we deeply describe the implementation of architectural elements proposed in our last work as well as new improvements proposed in the current year.

A sensor node should have the longest lifetime possible, since we need to build a system that performs its functions effectively and, at the same time, spends the least amount of energy, allowing the battery to last longer. One of the functions that consumes more energy in a WSN is the wireless data transmission. In this context, it becomes interesting to determine a setting of transmission powers for the network sensor nodes so the network remains connected while nodes\u2019 transmission powers remain minimum. The problem of minimizing the total energy consumption in a network is known in the literature as Strongly Minimum Energy Topology (SMET) and its decision version is known to be an NP-Complete problem. In this work, we evaluate the cost of adding fault tolerance through redundant paths to the SMET Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) topology, creating a redundant MST, a non-practical fault tolerant baseline algorithm. Next, we propose a practical redundant algorithm, Minimum Link Degree (MLD), which does not need any localization information and can be implemented in a distributed fashion. Our results show that the MLD topology is a promising approach, performing better than the redundant MST with respect to number of survived nodes\u2019 faults.",

        "description": "This paper proposes a multi-layered control strategy for deployment of an autonomous robot soccer team. The highest level of control corresponds to the decider of the soccer strategies (Ig, dribble, pass, shoot), to be defined with artificial intelligence algorithms and based on the state of the soccer game. Middle level controller uses a video camera, as feedback, to capture positions and angles and Lyapunov multivariable control technique calculate necessary wheels\u2019 speed in order to get the agents to desired positions, angles and speeds. The lowest level of control implements a PID (Propotional, Integral, Derivative) controller, using Arduino microcontroller platform and optical encoder sets, to output motors\u2019 voltage according to the wheels\u2019 speed determined in the middle level control. The hardware contruction and software implementation are also described. The final goal of this project is to build a team to compete in the Latin American Robotics Competition 2014, IEEE Very Small Soccer Size category.",

Programa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a base fundamental para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o das ferramentas da computa\u00e7\u00e3o. O objetivo deste livro \u00e9 ensinar os conceitos b\u00e1sicos de programa\u00e7\u00e3o utilizando como ferramenta de programa\u00e7\u00e3o a linguagem C, uma das mais usadas e importantes linguagens de programa\u00e7\u00e3o. O livro foca, desde o seu princ\u00edpio nas t\u00e9cnicas de modulariza\u00e7\u00e3o por fun\u00e7\u00f5es e por tipos abstratos de dados e minimiza a necessidade de conhecimento da arquitetura interna de computadores. Mais importante, o livro procura passar a mensagem ao leitor de que ele deve pensar e projetar uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o para a problema de programa\u00e7\u00e3o antes de efetivamente come\u00e7ar a programar sua solu\u00e7\u00e3o na linguagem de programa\u00e7\u00e3o.",

        "description": "O uso de sistemas P2P Video Streaming tem se tornado cada vez mais popular na Internet. Esta popularidade decorre de diversas vantagens apresentadas por estes sistemas como economia na banda de transmiss\u00e3o nos servidores e ganhos em escalabilidade. Entretanto, comprovar efetivamente os ganhos em sistemas reais \u00e9 um desafio importante e que poucos trabalhos t\u00eam dado aten\u00e7\u00e3o na literatura. A proposta desse artigo \u00e9 analisar dois sistemas de P2P Video Streaming baseado em medi\u00e7\u00f5es efetuadas experimentalmente de modo a quantificar i) a economia de banda no servidor e ii) a qualidade de experi\u00eancia percebida pelos usu\u00e1rios. Com este prop\u00f3sito, os sistemas SopCast e Goalbit foram escolhidos, implantados e avaliados no ambiente configurado. Os resultados obtidos mostram economia de banda elevada nos dois sistemas, sendo que o Goalbit obteve o melhor resultado para poucos clientes, enquanto o SopCast foi superior com um n\u00famero elevado de clientes. A qualidade de experi\u00eancia foi sutilmente superior no Goalbit, por\u00e9m em uma rede congestionada o SopCast obteve melhor desempenho.Abstract. The use of P2P Video Streaming systems has increasingly becoming popular. This popularity stems from several advantages presented by this systems as economies in servers transmission bandwidth and improvements in scalability. However, effectively demonstrate the gains, in real systems, is a major challenge that few studies have given attention in the literature. The objective of this paper is to analyze two P2P Video Streaming systems based on experimental measurements performed in order to quantify i\u00a0\u2026",
