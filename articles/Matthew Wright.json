This approach can be amplified using targeted clickbait that takes publicly available information from social media to align clickbait to users\u2019 preferences and beliefs. In this work, we first conducted preliminary studies to understand the influence of targeted clickbait on users\u2019 clicking behavior. Based on our findings, we involved 24 users in the participatory design of story-based warnings against targeted clickbait. Our analysis of user-created warnings led to four design variations, which we evaluated through an online survey over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our findings show the significance of integrating information with persuasive narratives to create effective warnings against targeted clickbait. Overall\u00a0\u2026"

These attacks allow an adversary to deduce the website a Tor user has visited by simply eavesdropping on the encrypted communication. This has consequently motivated the development of many defense strategies that obfuscate traffic through the addition of dummy packets and/or delays. The efficacy and practicality of many of these recent proposals have yet to be scrutinized in detail. In this study, we re-evaluate nine recent defense proposals that claim to provide adequate security with low-overheads using the latest Deep Learning-based attacks. Furthermore, we assess the feasibility of implementing these defenses within the current confines of Tor. To this end, we additionally provide the first on-network implementation of the DynaFlow defense to better assess its real-world utility.",

On a typical day, antivirus vendors receive hundreds of thousands of unique pieces of software, both malicious and benign, and over the course of the lifetime of a malware classifier, more than a billion samples can easily accumulate. Given the scale of the problem, sequential training using continual learning techniques could provide substantial benefits in reducing training and storage overhead. To date, however, there has been no exploration of CL applied to malware classification tasks. In this paper, we study 11 CL techniques applied to three malware tasks covering common incremental learning scenarios, including task, class, and domain incremental learning (IL). Specifically, using two realistic, large-scale malware datasets, we evaluate the performance of the CL methods on both binary malware classification (Domain-IL) and multi-class malware family classification (Task-IL and Class-IL) tasks. To our surprise, continual learning methods significantly underperformed naive {\\em Joint} replay of the training data in nearly all settings\u2013in some cases reducing accuracy by more than 70 percentage points. A simple approach of selectively replaying 20% of the stored data achieves better performance, with 50% of the training time compared to {\\em Joint} replay. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for the unexpectedly poor performance of the CL techniques, with the hope that it spurs further research on developing\u00a0\u2026",

The pressing need to detect these videos has motivated researchers to develop different types of detection models. Among them, the models that utilize temporal information (i.e., sequence-based models) are more effective at detection than the ones that only detect intra-frame discrepancies. Recent work has shown that the latter detection models can be fooled with adversarial examples, leveraging the rich literature on crafting adversarial (still) images. It is less clear, however, how well these attacks will work on sequence-based models that operate on information taken over multiple frames. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Carlini-Wagner L2-norm attack to fool sequence-based deepfake detector models in both the white-box and black-box settings\u00a0\u2026",

However, despite recent work showing that individual flows can be correlated with high accuracy, the impact of even these state-of-the-art attacks is questionable due to a central drawback: their pairwise nature, requiring comparison between N 2  pairs of flows to deanonymize N users. This results in a combinatorial explosion in computational requirements and an asymptotically declining base rate, leading to either high numbers of false positives or vanishingly small rates of successful correlation. In this paper, we introduce a novel flow correlation attack, DeepCoFFEA, that combines two ideas to overcome these drawbacks. First, DeepCoFFEA uses deep learning to train a pair of feature embedding networks that respectively map Tor and exit flows\u00a0\u2026",

Because of this, increasing attention has been paid to explainability in deep learning, including in the area of video understanding. Due to the temporal dimension of video data, the main challenge of explaining a video action recognition model is to produce spatiotemporally consistent visual explanations, which has been ignored in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose Frequency-based Extremal Perturbation (F-EP) to explain a video understanding model's decisions. Because the explanations given by perturbation methods are noisy and non-smooth both spatially and temporally, we propose to modulate the frequencies of gradient maps from the neural network model with a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We show in a range of experiments that F-EP provides more spatiotemporally consistent explanations that more faithfully represent the model's decisions compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

In contrast to most earlier work on deep-learning for WF, GANDaLF is intended to work with few training samples, and achieves this goal through the use of a Generative Adversarial Network to generate a large set of \u201cfake\u201d data that helps to train a deep neural network in distinguishing between classes of actual training data. We evaluate GANDaLF in low-data scenarios including as few as 10 training instances per site, and in multiple settings, including fingerprinting of website index pages and fingerprinting of non-index pages within a site. GANDaLF achieves closed-world accuracy of 87% with just 20 instances per site (and 100 sites) in standard WF settings. In particular, GANDaLF can outperform Var-CNN and Triplet Fingerprinting (TF) across all settings in subpage fingerprinting. For example, GANDaLF outperforms TF by a 29% margin and Var-CNN by 38% for training sets using 20 instances per site.",

This leads us to explore the hypothesis that adversarial detection methods, which have been shown to be ineffective against adaptive digital adversarial examples, can be effective against these physical attacks. We use one such detection method based on autoencoder architectures, and perform adversarial patching experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10 against a CNN architecture and two CapsNet architectures. We also propose two modifications to the EM-Routed CapsNet architecture, Affine Voting and Matrix Capsule Dropout, to improve its classification performance. Our investigation shows that the detector retains some of its effectiveness even against adaptive adversarial patch attacks. In addition, detection performance tends to decrease among all the architectures with the increase of dataset complexity.",

It is thus important to understand the capabilities of an attacker to identify homoglyphs - particularly ones that have not been previously spotted - and leverage them in attacks. We investigate a deep-learning model using embedding learning, transfer learning, and augmentation to determine the visual similarity of characters and thereby identify potential homoglyphs. Our approach uniquely takes advantage of weak labels that arise from the fact that most characters are not homoglyphs. Our model drastically outperforms the Normal-ized Compression Distance approach on pairwise homoglyph identification, for which we achieve an average precision of 0.97. We also present the first attempt at clustering homoglyphs into sets of equivalence classes, which is more efficient than\u00a0\u2026",

The value of timing information to WF has often been discounted in recent works due to the volatility of low-level timing information. In this paper, we more carefully examine the extent to which packet timing can be used to facilitate WF attacks. We first propose a new set of timing-related features based on burst-level characteristics to further identify more ways that timing patterns could be used by classifiers to identify sites. Then we evaluate the effectiveness of both raw timing and directional timing which is a combination of raw timing and direction in a deep-learning-based WF attack. Our closed-world evaluation shows that directional timing performs best in most of the settings we explored, achieving: (i) 98.4% in undefended Tor traffic; (ii) 93.5% on WTF-PAD traffic, several points higher than when only directional information is used; and (iii) 64.7% against onion sites, 12% higher than using only direction. Further evaluations in the open-world setting show small increases in both precision (+2%) and recall (+6%) with directional-timing on WTF-PAD traffic. To further investigate the value of timing information, we perform an information leakage analysis on our proposed handcrafted features. Our results show that while timing features leak less information than directional features, the information contained in each feature is mutually exclusive to one another and can thus improve the robustness of a classifier.",

As these manipulations become more convincing, they can be used to place public figures into manufactured scenarios, effectively making it appear that anybody could say anything. Even if the public does not believe these are real, it will generally make video evidence appear less reliable as a source of validation, such that people no long trust anything they see. This increases the pressure on trusted agents in the media to help validate video and audio for the general public. To support this, we propose to develop a robust and an intuitive system to help journalists detect deepfakes. This paper presents a study of the perceptions, current procedures, and expectations of journalists regarding such a tool. We then combine technical knowledge of media forensics and the findings of the study to design a system for detection of deepfake videos that is usable by, and useful for, journalists.",

        "description": "Facebook, the largest social networking site (SNS) with over one billion active monthly users, has been woven into the everyday life of many people. While this platform has drastically improved how we interact with one another, it has also opened up a multitude of security and privacy issues. For example, online attackers are increasingly employing phishing attacks on Facebook, seeking to fool their victims by posing as friends using fake or compromised accounts. These attacks are hard to recognize by the Facebook defense system and users alike, and few studies give any insight into how users interact with such attacks. In this study, we take the first step to understand how users react and decide whether to click when they encounter SNS posts with links, including possibly suspicious links. We found that users decide to interact with shared contents based on their relationship with the post author (from whose account the post is shared; perhaps compromised). At the same time, they mostly ignore the location of the shared post (eg, post author\u2019s wall or target user\u2019s wall), and any context pointing to a post possibly being suspicious. We also explored the potential of showing a visual warning for suspicious posts. Although our simple warning system failed to prevent users from clicking on suspicious posts altogether, it did reduce the likelihood of users clicking on such posts. Based on our findings, we identified the scope of future work to protect users against phishing attacks in SNSes.",

        "description": "The Tor anonymity system provides online privacy for millions of users, but it is slower than typical web browsing. To improve Tor performance, we propose PredicTor, a path selection technique that uses a Random Forest classifier trained on recent measurements of Tor to predict the performance of a proposed path. If the path is predicted to be fast, then the client builds a circuit using those relays. We implemented PredicTor in the Tor source code and show through live Tor experiments and Shadow simulations that PredicTor improves Tor network performance by 11% to 23% compared to Vanilla Tor and by 7% to 13% compared to the previous state-of-the-art scheme. Our experiments show that PredicTor is the first path selection algorithm to dynamically avoid highly congested nodes during times of high congestion and avoid long-distance paths during times of low congestion. We evaluate the anonymity of PredicTor using standard entropy-based and time-to-first-compromise metrics, but these cannot capture the possibility of leakage due to the use of location in path selection. To better address this, we propose a new anonymity metric called CLASI: Client Autonomous System Inference. CLASI is the first anonymity metric in Tor that measures an adversary's ability to infer client Autonomous Systems (ASes) by fingerprinting circuits at the network, country, and relay level. We find that CLASI shows anonymity loss for location-aware path selection algorithms, where entropy-based metrics show little to no loss of anonymity. Additionally, CLASI indicates that PredicTor has similar sender AS leakage compared to the current Tor path selection\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "The mechanism for picking guards in Tor suffers from security problems like guard fingerprinting and from performance issues. To address these issues, Hayes and Danezis proposed the use of guard sets, in which the Tor system groups all guards into sets, and each client picks one of these sets and uses its guards. Unfortunately, guard sets frequently need nodes added or they are broken up due to fluctuations in network bandwidth. In this paper, we first show that these breakups create opportunities for malicious guards to join many guard sets by merely tuning the bandwidth they make available to Tor, and this greatly increases the number of clients exposed to malicious guards. To address this problem, we propose a new method for forming guard sets based on Internet location. We construct a hierarchy that keeps clients and guards together more reliably and prevents guards from easily joining arbitrary guard sets. This approach also has the advantage of confining an attacker with access to limited locations on the Internet to a small number of guard sets. We simulate this guard set design using historical Tor data in the presence of both relay-level adversaries and network-level adversaries, and we find that our approach is good at confining the adversary into few guard sets, thus limiting the impact of attacks.",

It is known that general-purpose communications, such as web and file transfer, are difficult to protect in that setting. However, online instant messaging only requires a low bandwidth and we show it to be amenable to strong anonymity protections. In this paper, we describe the design and engineering of LiLAC, a Lightweight Low-latency Anonymous Chat service, that offers both strong anonymity and a lightweight client-side presence. LiLAC implements a set of anonymizing relays, and offers stronger anonymity protections by applying dependent link padding on top of constant-rate traffic flows.

Then, in a study of interference effects in Geopass, in which each participant had to remember four separate location passwords, we found that memorability was <70%, with 41.5% of login failures due to interference.

        "description": "Tor provides anonymity online by routing traffic through encrypted tunnels, called circuits, over paths of anonymizing relays. To enable users to connect to their selected destination servers without waiting for the circuit to be build, the Tor client maintains a few circuits at all times. Nevertheless, Tor is slower to use than directly connecting to the destination server. In this paper, we propose to have the Tor client measure the performance of the pre-built circuits and select the fastest circuits for users to send their traffic over. To this end, we define and evaluate nine metrics for selecting which pre-built circuit to use based on different combinations of circuit length, Round Trip Time (RTT), and congestion. We also explore the effect on performance of the number of pre-built circuits at the time of the selection. Through whole-network experiments in Shadow, we show that using circuit RTT with at least three pre-built circuits allows the Tor client to identify fast circuits and improves median time to first byte (TTFB) by 22% over Tor and 15% over congestion-aware routing, the state-of-the-art in Tor circuit selection. We evaluate the security of the proposed circuit selection mechanism against both a relay-level and a network-level adversary and find no loss of security compared with Tor.",

As its popularity grows, more businesses are starting to accept it as payment, including services like fast food restaurants and vending machines that must deliver goods soon upon payment. Unfortunately, these fast pay scenarios are vulnerable to fraudulent double-spending of Bitcoins. To protect consumers from having to cover the costs of these attacks, there is a growing need to find countermeasures to such attacks that are scalable and realistic to deploy. Several possible countermeasures have been proposed in prior work but not evaluated carefully. In this paper, we analyze these countermeasures and simulate their effects in a scaled Bitcoin P2P network using the Shadow framework. We find that integrating several of these countermeasures into an enhanced observer can be effective in detecting and alerting a vendor to an incoming double-spend attack in less than 28 seconds on average in our model.",

When the image is sexually explicit and involves a child, the scale of this privacy violation grows tremendously worse and can have repercussions for the victim\u2019s whole life. Providing investigators with tools that can identify the perpetrators of child pornography (CP) trafficking is critical to addressing these violations. Investigators are interested in identifying these perpetrators on Freenet, which supports the anonymous publication and retrieval of data and is widely used for CP trafficking. We confirmed that 70,000 manifests posted to public forums dedicated to child sexual abuse contained tens of thousands of known CP images including infants and toddlers. About 35% of traffic on Freenet was for these specific manifests. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel approach for investigating these privacy violations. In particular, our approach aims to distinguish whether a neighboring peer is the actual requester of a file or just forwarding the requests for other peers. Our method requires only a single peer that passively analyzes the traffic it is sent by a neighbor. We derive a Bayesian framework that models the observer\u2019s decision for whether the neighbor is the downloader, and we show why the sum traffic from downloaders relayed by the neighbor is not a significant source of false positives. We validate our model in simulation, finding near perfect results, and we validate our approach by applying it to real CP-related manifests and actual packet data from Freenet, for which we find a false positive rate of about 2%.

Since worms can enable an adversary to quickly compromise an entire sensor network, they must be detected and stopped as quickly as possible. To meet this need, we propose a worm propagation detection scheme for sensor networks. The proposed scheme applies a sequential analysis to detect worm propagation by leveraging the intuition that a worm's communication pattern is different from benign traffic. In particular, a worm in a sensor network requires a long sequence of packets propagating hop-by-hop to each new infected node in turn. We thus have detectors that observe communication patterns in the network, a worm spreading hop-by-hop will quickly create chains of connections that would not be seen in normal traffic. Once detector nodes identify the worm propagation pattern, they initiate remote\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "System-assigned random passwords offer security guarantees against guessing attacks but suffer from poor memorability. In this work, we review the cognitive psychology literature and identify two training methods appropriate to aid users in memorizing system-assigned passwords. The method of loci exploits users\u2019 spatial and visual memory, while the link method helps users by creating a chain of memory cues. We developed techniques to automatically take a given random password and generate training aids (videos) based on each of these methods. The results of a memorability study showed that both methods were significantly better than a control condition (no training) and that the method of loci had a login success rate of 86%, a high value for any recall-based study with system-assigned passwords. With a registration time of 160 seconds and a median login time of 9 seconds, this method holds promise as a direction to addressing the usability-security trade-off in user authentication. We further extend this idea to help users memorize long system-assigned random passwords that offer almost crypto-level security and conduct a second memorability study. The results of this study demonstrated that with the help of a password hint, 81% of participants were able to recall the password after a week. This indicates that the method of loci can be leveraged to help users memorize cryptographically-strong secret in just one session, and thus offers a more viable alternative to the spaced repetition technique, which involves dozens of sessions of user training.",

Automated attacks, such as worms, may be particularly prevalent threats. An IoT worm may have trouble, however, with robust and stealthy propagation in such lossy wireless networks with lower resource nodes. To mitigate this problem, we propose a split-pipeline model, in which worm codes are broken into multiple fragments and propagated in a fragment-by-fragment manner, where the reassembled fragments can be used to infect benign nodes. Secret sharing is used for the split-reassemble process, since it both conceals the codes and allows for full recovery of the code even if some fragments are lost in transmission under lossy wireless networks. Furthermore, each fragment of the worm code is transmitted in a pipeline architecture for faster propagation.",

Although passwords serve as the first authentication factor, a common approach to implementing the second factor is sending a one-time code, either via e-mail or text message. The prevalence of smartphones, however, creates security risks in which a stolen phone leads to user\u2019s accounts being accessed. Physical tokens such as RSA\u2019s SecurID create extra burdens for users and cannot be used on many accounts at once. This study aims to improve the usability and security for two-factor online authentication.Design/methodology/approachThe authors propose a novel second authentication factor that, similar to passwords, is also based on something the user knows but operates similarly to a one-time code for security purposes.

Further, since the AS path from the client\u2019s exit to her destination can only be inferred once the destination is known, the prior approaches may have problems constructing circuits in advance, which is important for Tor performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate DeNASA, a new approach to ASaware path selection that is destination-naive, in that it does not need to know the client\u2019s destination to pick paths, and that takes advantage of Tor\u2019s circuit selection algorithm. To this end, we first identify the most probable ASes to be traversed by Tor streams. We call this set of ASes the Suspect AS list and find that it consists of eight highest ranking Tier 1 ASes. Then, we test the accuracy of Qiu and Gao AS-level path inference on identifying the presence of these ASes in the path, and we show that inference accuracy is 90%. We develop an AS-aware algorithm called DeNASA that uses Qiu and Gao inference to avoid Suspect ASes. DeNASA reduces Tor stream vulnerability by 74%. We also show that DeNASA has performance similar to Tor. Due to the destination-naive property, time to first byte (TTFB) is close to Tor\u2019s, and due to leveraging Tor\u2019s bandwidthweighted relay selection, time to last byte (TTLB) is also similar to Tor\u2019s.",

In practice, social network connections change over time, and attackers can also cause limited changes to the networks. In this work, we focus on the temporal dynamics of a variety of social-network-based Sybil defenses.

We argue that this is because existing password schemes do not fully leverage humans' cognitive strengths, and we thus examine techniques to enhance password memorability that incorporate scientic understanding of long-term memory. In our study, we examine the efficacy of spatial cues (fixed position of images), verbal cues (phrases/facts related to the images), and employing user interaction (learning images through writing a short description at registration) to improve the memorability of passwords based on face images and object images. We conducted a multi-session in-lab user study with 56 participants, where each participant was assigned seven different graphical passwords, each representing one study condition. One week after registration, participants had a 98% login success rate for a scheme offering spatial and verbal cues, while the scheme based on user interaction had a 95% login success rate for face images and a 93% login success rate for object images.

Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of textual passwords to shoulder surfing and keystroke loggers. It remains a critical challenge in password research to develop an authentication scheme that addresses these security issues, in addition to offering good memorability. Motivated by psychology research on humans' cognitive strengths and weaknesses, we explore the potential of cognitive questions as a way to address the major challenges in user authentication. We design, implement, and evaluate Q-A, a novel cognitive-question-based password system that requires a user to enter the letter at a given position in her answer for each of six personal questions (e.g. \"What is the name of your favorite childhood teacher?\"). In this scheme, the user does not need to memorize new, artificial information as her authentication secret. Our scheme offers 28 bits of theoretical password space, which has been found sufficient to prevent online brute-force attacks. Q-A is also robust against shoulder surfing and keystroke loggers. We conducted a multi-session in-lab user study to evaluate the usability of Q-A; 100% of users were able to remember their Q-A password over the span of one week, although login times were high. We compared our scheme with random six character passwords and found that login success rate in Q-A was significantly higher. Based on our results, we suggest that Q-A would be most appropriate in contexts that demand high security and where logins occur infrequently (e.g., online bank accounts).",

By applying standard techniques of psychometrics, we develop a questionnaire (known as a scale in psychometrics) that measures the comfort of constructing a strong password when using a particular interface. We establish the essential psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of this scale and demonstrate how the scale can be used to profile password construction interfaces of popular smartphone handsets. We also theoretically conceptualize user comfort across different dimensions and use confirmatory factor analysis to verify our theory.

Traditional security mechanisms, like encryption, have been proven to be ineffective as the location of the source can also be revealed by analyzing the traffic flow in the network. In this paper, we investigate the source-location privacy issue. We first propose a realistic semi-global eavesdropping attack model and show its effectiveness in compromising an existing source-location preserving technique.

        "description": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have great practical importance for surveillance systems to perform monitoring by acquiring and sending information on any intrusion in a secured area. Requirement of very little human intervention is one of the most desirable features of WSNs, thus making it a cheaper and safer alternative for securing large areas such as international borders. Jamming attacks in WSNs can be applied to disrupt communications among the sensor nodes in the network. Since it is difficult to prevent jamming attacks, detection and mapping out the jammed regions is critical to overcome this problem. In a security monitoring scenario, the network operators will be able to take proper measures against jamming once the jammed regions in the network are known to them. It is also desirable to keep the interactions of the sensor nodes in the network minimal, as they are low powered devices and need to conserve their resources. In this paper we propose a light-weight technique for faster mapping of the jammed regions. We minimize the load on the sensors by removing the actual responsibility of mapping from the network to the central base station (BS). After a few nodes report to the BS, it carries out the task of mapping of the jammed regions in the network. We use our simulation results to compare our proposed system with the existing techniques and also to measure the performance of our system. Our results show that the jammed regions in a network can be mapped from fewer nodes reporting to the base station.",

Spread spectrum mitigates these attacks by spreading normal narrowband signals over a much wider band of frequencies and forcing jammers who do not know the spreading pattern to expend much more effort to launch the attack. In broadcast systems, however, jammers can easily find out the spread pattern by compromising just a single receiver. Several group-based ideas have been proposed to deal with compromised receivers; they can tolerate up to t malicious receivers by adding 2t extra copies for each broadcast message. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme with random channel sharing. This scheme reduces the communication cost from 2t to (1\u00a0+\u00a0p)t extra copies, where p determines the channel sharing probability (0\u00a0<\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a01).

First, paths for anonymous communication are built without considering trust relationships between users and relays in the system. Second, the network architecture relies on a set of centralized servers. In this paper, we propose Pisces, a decentralized protocol for anonymous communications that leverages users' social links to build circuits for onion routing. We argue that such an approach greatly improves the system's resilience to attackers. A fundamental challenge in this setting is the design of a secure process to discover peers for use in a user's circuit. All existing solutions for secure peer discovery leverage structured topologies and cannot be applied to unstructured social network topologies. In Pisces, we discover peers by using random walks in the social network graph with a bias away from highly connected nodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To secure the random walks, we leverage the reciprocal neighbor policy: if malicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery so as to improve the chance of being selected, then honest nodes can use a tit-for-tat approach and reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes from their routing tables. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy, and use it to build the Pisces anonymity system. Using theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network topologies, we show that (a) the reciprocal neighbor policy mitigates active attacks that an adversary can perform, (b) our decentralized\u00a0\u2026",

Our aim is to examine the effect that background cover - the cover traffic sent by other users - has on the effectiveness of statistical disclosure attacks. Since the original SDA does not explicitly account for background traffic volumes, we developed an extension to the SDA called SDA-2H that uses this information to improve upon the SDA.

Similarly, software-attestation schemes detect the subverted software modules of compromised nodes.

It is crucial to detect such jamming attacks as fast as possible. Existing studies have shown that an effective indicator of jamming is the packet delivery ratio (PDR). However, current PDR-based schemes use the end-to-end packet delivery ratio, which requires one to observe communication for a long time before a good decision is made. In this paper, we propose collaborative detection, which evaluates the packet delivery ratio in an given area instead of a pair of nodes. The intuition is that the attacker often jams an area of his interest, not just two specific nodes. The benefit is that we can detect jamming attacks in a much faster way. We have evaluated the performance of our idea on TelosB motes. The results show that we can effectively and quickly detect jamming\u00a0\u2026",

In performing DDoS and false data injection attacks, he takes advantage of diversifying the attack paths with mobile malicious nodes to prevent network-level defenses. For attacks that disrupt or undermine network protocols like routing and clustering, moving the misbehaving nodes prevents them from being easily identified and blocked.

Existing techniques defend the leakage of location information from a limited adversary who can only observe network traffic in a small region. However, a stronger adversary, the global eavesdropper, is realistic and can defeat these existing techniques.

However, an attacker can use long-term statistical analysis of traffic sent to and from such a system to link senders with their receivers.

Earlier work in this area proposes that privacy-sensitive users generate and send cover traffic to the system. However, users are not online all the time and cannot be expected to send consistent levels of cover traffic; use of inconsistent cover traffic drastically reduces its impact. We propose that the anonymity system generate cover traffic that mimics the sending patterns of users in the system.

However, groups can be easily blocked from communicating through blocking of posts with the given hashtags. We propose #h00t, a system for censorship resistant microblogging. #h00t presents an interface that is much like Twitter, except that hashtags are replaced with very short hashes (e.g., 24 bits) of the group identifier. Naturally, with such short hashes, hashtags from different groups may collide and #h00t users will actually seek to create collisions. By encrypting all posts with keys derived from the group identifiers, #h00t client software can filter out other groups' posts while making such filtering difficult for the adversary. In essence, by leveraging collisions, groups can tunnel their posts in other groups' posts. A censor could not block a given group without also blocking the other groups with colliding hashtags. We evaluate the feasibility of #h00t through traces collected from Twitter, showing that a single modern computer has enough computational throughput to encrypt every tweet sent through Twitter in real time. We also use these traces to analyze the bandwidth and anonymity tradeoffs that would come with different variations on how group identifiers are encoded and hashtags are selected to purposefully collide with one another.",

This method is able to reliably detect known covert timing channels by using a combination of entropy and conditional entropy to detect anomalies in shape and regularity, respectively.

We report the results of extensive experimentation across 210 globally placed PlanetLab proxies which shows that paths for reasonable aVoIP quality would need to be selected carefully. Our design includes an algorithm for the measurement and selection of paths for reasonable aVoIP performance and an analysis of the potential for attackers to take advantage of this algorithm to improve existing attacks.

Mixes can prevent these attacks by inserting dummy packets (cover traffic) to obfuscate timing information in each stream. A recently proposed defense called adaptive padding makes cover traffic more effective by ensuring that statistically unusual gaps between packets are partially filled in with dummy packets. In this work, we propose Selective Cross Correlation (SCC), an attack that an eavesdropper could employ to de-anonymize users despite the use of adaptive padding.

A critical security concern in such systems is the access of faulty resources, thereby wasting the requester's time and energy and possibly causing damage to her system. A common approach to mitigating the problem involves reputation mechanisms; however, since reputation relies on cooperation, a reputation mechanism's effectiveness can be significantly diminished in hostile environments. Reputation systems also require substantial communication among peers leading to: i) vulnerability to errors caused by intermittent connectivity; ii) message delivery disruptions caused by malicious peers; and iii) energy sapping message overheads.

There have been several recent studies on providing location privacy in sensor networks. However, these existing approaches assume a weak adversary model where the adversary sees only local network traffic. We first argue that a strong adversary model, the global eavesdropper, is often realistic in practice and can defeat existing techniques. We then formalize the location privacy issues under this strong adversary model and show how much communication overhead is needed for achieving a given level of privacy.

However, using long-term statistical analysis of traffic sent to and from such a system, it is possible to link senders with their receivers. Cover traffic is an effective, but somewhat limited, counter strategy against this attack. Earlier work in this area proposes that privacy-sensitive users generate and send cover traffic to the system. However, users are not online all the time and cannot be expected to send consistent levels of cover traffic, drastically reducing the impact of cover traffic. We propose that the mix generate cover traffic that mimics the sending patterns of users in the system. This receiver-bound cover helps to make up for users that aren\u2019t there, confusing the attacker.

MorphMix avoids this requirement for complete system knowledge, but users must rely on untrusted peers to select the path. This can lead to the attacker controlling the entire path more often than is acceptable.To overcome these problems, we propose Salsa, a structured approach to organizing highly distributed anonymous communications systems for scalability and security.
