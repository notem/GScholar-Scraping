Temporal awareness as an extension, or a special case, of situation awareness, may provide for useful measures of covert mental models applicable to numerous tasks and for input to human-aware AI agents. Temporal awareness measures may be used to classify human performance into the control modes in the contextual control model (COCOM): scrambled, opportunistic, tactical, and strategic. Twenty-one participants participated in a withinsubjects experiment with an abstract task of resetting four independent timers within their respective windows of opportunity.

The process is typically slow, spanning months, even years. A crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic presents a different problem. How can human factors and ergonomics professionals react quickly, within hours or days, to provide viable solutions to unanticipated problems as they become apparent? Here we report on a small project in which we were able to respond rapidly to an emergent COVID-19 requirement. Given time constraints, we had no opportunity to follow a systematic analysis and design strategy. Our development and testing strategies reveal lessons that can be applied more generally to development of human factors and ergonomics interventions within emerging crises.",

When examining the same using Fuzzy SDT, familiarity with phishing accounted for 6% of the variance in bias. Background in cybersecurity had a statistically significant effect on sensitivity and bias in classical SDT but only on bias in fuzzy SDT. A confusion matrix revealed that the percentage of successfully transmitted information from the stimuli to the judgements made by participants was only 26%.

In particular, human interactions with machine learning tools in clinical settings remain poorly researched. This review examined machine learning tools in two important areas, sepsis diagnosis and suicide prediction. However, our exploration into the use of machine learning in sepsis and suicide prediction turned up no thorough human factors analyses of provider interactions with their machine learning tools, suggesting a critical research gap waiting to be filled.",

We investigated attentional allocation by registering participants\u2019 eye movements while they performed a new time-sharing task that forced them to solve resource conflicts between subtasks through prioritization. Participants were monitoring four subtasks each requiring different amounts of visual attention and response frequencies. Participants\u2019 attention allocation was operationalized in terms of the time spent dwelling on subtasks, the rate they visually sampled the tasks, and the duration of dwells. Additionally, the accuracy of responses and efficiency of time-sharing were estimated. In Experiment 1, we studied adaptation to a time-sharing environment in which priority order of the subtasks was kept constant from trial to trial. We found that the participants sampled the most important subtasks more frequently\u00a0\u2026",

As such, we question whether students are adequately prepared if they are not learning, at least in part, from instructors who have real-world experience applying human factors/ergonomics knowledge to practical design problems. A wide variety of other disciplines such as medicine, the building trades, clinical psychology, military strategy, aviation, and the visual and performing arts have all faced this question and come up with educational approaches that typically include educators who are highly skilled in the practice of the discipline. Terms such as practitioner-scholar and scientist-practitioner, and the apprentice models all reflect this notion of students learning from highly skilled, knowledgeable, and practiced professionals in their disciplines. Is it time for human factors/ergonomics education to adopt such a model?"

Data science and emerging technologies offer challenges and opportunities for early-career human factors professionals who are looking to grow their careers and their human factors practice. In this paper, we report on a survey to assess the perspectives of students currently studying human factors. The survey items examined shortfalls in current human factors education with re-spect to relevance to industry trends. The survey results show that students see a need to include more relevant subjects in data science, as well as opportunities to learn trending industry problems, hands-on experience with real-life projects, prior to graduation."

They are rare but have widespread consequences, many defenses and multiple causes, they are associated with judging and deciding, and have a long \u201chistory\u201d. Organizational accidents are also associated with highly regulated industries, such as aviation. There are several other constructs related to organizational factors undermining safety. Aviation is unfortunately closely associated with the traditional \u201cSafety I\u201d thinking, where adverse outcomes can be found at the end of causal chain and treating, and preferably eliminating, the causes will increase safety by preventing future accidents. An alternative view is \u201cSafety II\u201d, where the focus is on what goes right rather than on what goes wrong. Safety II is thus defined as the ability to succeed under expected and unexpected conditions alike. Yet another viewpoint is Work-As-Imagined vs. Work-As-Done. In the former case, the focus is on accident and incident investigation and elimination of noncompliance errors (\u201cname, blame, train\u201d). In contrast, the latter perspective does away with both well-defined functions and malfunctions and accepts that performance is variable as a matter of fact and that the same variability can result in both success and failure. Because performance variability allows for adjustment to changing situations, it is the reason why everyday work is safe and effective.",

The task bears resemblance to one performed by air traffic controllers who track multiple moving aircraft, where they are identified with relatively complex alphanumeric call signs. In Experiment 1, stimulus familiarity was manipulated by comparing the tracking of familiar words and pseudowords. In Experiment 2, also stimulus complexity was varied by having the participants track short and long words. Stimulus complexity affected tracking: Short words were easier to track than long words. Moreover, familiarity of identity affected tracking of short words (short familiar words were easier to track than short pseudo\u2010words) but not of long words. The results are interpreted within the framework of the model of multiple identity tracking model.

Many working with DS techniques rely on the concept of \u201cblack boxes\u201d to explain how ML works, noting that algorithms find patterns in the data that humans might not. While the mathematics are still being developed, the implications for the application of ML, specifically to questions of automation, also are being studied, but still remain poorly understood. The decisions made by ML practitioners with respect to data selection, model training and testing, data visualization, and model applications remain relatively unconstrained and have the potential to yield unexpected results at the systems level. Unfortunately, human factors engineers concerned with automation often have limited training and awareness of DS and ML\u00a0\u2026",

The products of this system of analyses can then be directly transformed into design requirements for information systems. Doing CWA by hand is quite tedious, however, and larger projects where data are collected from multiple individuals doing the same task differently, or when multiple different tasks are included in a larger-scale CWA, pose special challenges. It is apparent that streamlined documentation and support tool for CWA is needed. Even at a cost of some lost flexibility, the benefits of a software tool to support data collection are apparent. The tool should also support the analyses of large amounts of data from multiple operators within a large system, where individual differences in ways of doing things are expected.

This knowledge corresponds to the concept of Situation Awareness (SA), specifically Level 1 SA. The underlying research paradigm concerns tracking of identical objects moving on a screen (Multiple Object Tracking, MOT). This method has been useful to investigate the fundamentals of visual tracking, but it lacks a connection to real-world scenarios. In another paradigm, objects tracked have unique identities (Multiple Identity Tracking, MIT) requiring a combination of peripheral and focal perception in tracking. This model has been used to examine air traffic controllers\u2019 SA. This paper will report results from an experiment where objects with identities similar to typical air traffic control (ATC) call signs were displayed on a plan-view display. The 4-and 8-object conditions replicated previous research and a 12-object condition simulated the density of typical ATC displays. The displays were static to examine the time required to create identity-location bindings (Level 1 SA). The displays were periodically blanked and participants queried about locations of target objects. Location errors and response times were recorded. The object array size of 4 had the highest accuracy and shortest time to acquire good SA. As the object set size increased from 4 objects to 12 objects, location errors increased dramatically. In sum, participants could reliably retain locations and identities of only about three objects. This finding has implications to the capacity of controllers to maintain adequate SA in future ATC systems.",

One of the primary challenges of information display for a power transmission control room application is the clutter from displaying too much information in too small of a display space. Thus, the task to optimize the layout of visual elements consisting of substations and transmission lines on the display interface is of vital importance. To this end, algorithms using several optimization techniques including Lagrangian relaxation and progressive hedging are proposed in this paper to make the interface less cluttered subject to human perceptual and cognitive capabilities. We conduct extensive computational studies to evaluate and compare the developed algorithms, and report our findings based on a real-world power grid in the US",

No other resource can provide a designer with specifications based on sound science than a good standards book or info-guide. However, designers usually come up with ideas to solve problems and leave the manufacturing and technical specifications to the engineers. Although they may be aware of the basic user needs, designers rarely look at standards to justify their design thinking and validate their design processes. The two studies reported in this paper investigated the awareness of, accessibility, and usability of human factors/ergonomics standards among college students and their professors in design-oriented programs, as well as among practicing designers.

The dual process model (Evans, 2008) posits two types of decision-making, which may be ordered on a continuum from intuitive to analytical (Hammond, 1981). Training clinicians to recognize decision-making style and select the most appropriate mode of reasoning for a particular context may help reduce diagnostic error (Norman, 2009). This study makes preliminary steps towards detection of decision style, based on an annotated dataset of image-based clinical reasoning in which speech data were collected from physicians as they inspected images of dermatological cases and moved towards diagnosis (Hochberg et al., 2014). A classifier was developed based on lexical, speech, disfluency, physician demographic, cognitive, and diagnostic difficulty features. Using random forests for binary classification of intuitive vs. analytical decision style in physicians\u2019 diagnostic descriptions, the model improved on the baseline by over 30%. The introduced computational model provides construct validity for decision styles, as well as insights into the linguistic expression of decision-making. Eventually, such modeling may be incorporated into instructional systems that teach clinicians to become more effective decision makers.",

Objective measures of clinician-patient communications in both naturalistic and simulated settings is a promising way to examine clinician decision making under uncertainty and time pressure, and to identify specific errors in decision making that may lead to misdiagnoses.

In particular, there has almost been no progress in the area of human factors validation of complex system in the 20 years since the publication of Wise, Hopkin, and Stager\u2019s (1993) seminal volume on the topic. Yet, large-scale modernization efforts of air transportation infrastructure in the US (NextGen) and elsewhere should by all reason have proved to be a boon to research on validation and verification methods. Alas, this appears not to be the case. This session in the 4th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics and the 1st International Conference on Human Factors in Transportation was put together to refocus the attention on verification and validation of NextGen technologies and procedures. The five papers in the session address diverse questions about validation of different components of\u00a0\u2026"

This paper reviews previous taxonomies of the content of airground communications between pilots and controllers and the most recent findings on the type, frequency, and function of existing communication technologies. Methods of analysis and metrics of relevant variables derived from ATC voice data are presented in order to illustrate the rich and complex communication strategies controllers currently employ.

For over ten years, a traditional Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) technique, the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) has been used in hospitals nationwide in an attempt to explain why these errors occur and what can be done to prevent them. Still, patient safety has not improved significantly. Traditional HRA techniques are limited as analysis tools. They do not consider the context in which workers operate. They are also not based on valid psychological models that can explain human cognitive function. The Cognitive Reliability and Analysis Method (CREAM) is a HRA technique that allows analysts to examine worker actions through the context of performance-shaping factors and is based on a model of human cognition. We reviewed 87 archived RCA reports conducted by a hospital in New York State and re-analyzed 58 cases using CREAM. Despite data limitations, we discovered a possible gap between the hospital\u2019s RCAs and the results of the CREAM analyses. The gap suggests that the CREAM identified organizational and leadership factors contributing to the cause of medical error which the RCA process either minimized or ignored.",

Due to potentially very high number of variables and complexity of the underlying data structure that render standard statistical techniques inadequate, novel techniques that perform nonlinear regression and pattern recognition along with feature selection and variable selection are potential candidates for such analyses.

First, we conducted a systematic review of the conflict detection literature to identify studies that focused on conflict risk assessments and studies that focused on conflict avoidance (intervention). We then report empirical data pertaining to controller intervention judgments. Studies on conflict avoidance have rarely described the intervention decision making process and its interaction with the conflict risk assessment process, whereas our data indicated differences in terms of information processing between judgments of conflict risk and intervention judgments. We provide recommendation for future studies on conflict detection and conflict avoidance. These findings also have implications for the development of automated conflict detection tools."

Other domains (such as transportation and energy) have used techniques and methods from the engineering disciplines to analyze and ultimately reduce instances of error. In New York State (NYS), the Department of Health (DOH) requires the use of one such method, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), in investigating and reporting the occurrence of and response to sentinel events by hospitals. Despite the use of the RCA technique in an attempt to identify and mitigate the root causes of error, the problem of human error contributing to sentinel events persists. Experts in Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) contend that human performance is too complex to be represented by models used in engineering systems reliability. A method to analyze human erroneous actions was created that considers operator context and control based on a model of human cognition. The technique, called the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM), was used to reanalyze 58 sentinel event cases Rochester General Hospital previously analyzed using RCA. Despite serious data limitations, our results reveal an apparent gap between RCA and CREAM analyses. We suggest that the gap highlights incomplete RCA that minimizes or does not appreciate the role that organizational factors play in contributing to the sentinel events. Due to data limitations, we cannot identify specific interventions to mitigate risk for sentinel events.

This was achieved using an identity tracking task, in which objects (line-drawings of familiar objects) first move for 5 s, after which they temporarily disappear from view. In order to examine different aspects of vector information, we compared 4 velocity vector conditions: (1) no vectors were displayed; (2) only a history trail was displayed; (3) a condition where the end of the velocity vector pointed to exactly where the objects would reappear after the masking; (4) a constant heading length was displayed. Based on recent studies on Keane and Pylyshyn (2006) and Oinonen et al.

The results supported this hypothesis by indicating that history trail or directional vector\u00a0\u2026",

This research sought evidence for air traffic controllers' awareness of temporal characteristics of their tasks in data from a high-fidelity system evaluation simulation. Five teams of controllers worked on four scenarios with different traffic load. Several temporal parameters were defined for each task controllers performed during a simulation run and their actions on the tasks were timed relative to them. Controllers showed a strong tendency to prioritize tasks according to a first come, first served principle. This trend persisted as task load increased. Also evident was awareness of the urgency of tasks, as tasks with impending closing of a window of opportunity were performed before tasks that had longer time available before closing of the window.",

It is important to understand just how large departures from the current ingrained practices the NextGen procedures represent, particularly in extremely safetycritical tasks such as airborne conflict resolutions. Pilots\u2019 conflict resolution maneuver preferences have received some attention, but corresponding research on air traffic controllers\u2019 practices is almost nonexistent. We analyzed 87 samples of aircraft track data involving conflict alerts and subsequent resolution maneuvers from Atlanta center. Vertical conflict resolution maneuvers were used in the majority of the cases examined. Within the vertical dimension, reductions of current vertical change (climb or descent) were collectively the most frequent resolution maneuver type, but descents were twice as frequent as climbs. Conflict resolution maneuvers furthermore do not seem to be independent from conflict geometries."

Fourteen expert controllers made conflict risk judgments about air traffic situations in which three variables (conflict geometry, time of closest point of approach or TCPA, and vertical separation between aircraft) were manipulated. The results indicate that conflict geometry, TCPA, and the vertical separation between aircraft significantly influenced judgments of conflict risk. In addition, there was a significant interaction between these three variables. Risk perception was largest under conditions where aircraft were on the same headings, with short TCPA, and no minimum vertical separation. The study was successful in determining what factors of air traffic scenarios increased subjective risk judgments in air traffic control."

Method Twenty-four pilots viewed dynamic encounters between their own aircraft and an intruder aircraft on a simulated CDTI; difficulty was varied by the intruder aircraft's distance and time to closest point of approach (CPA), relative speed, miss distance at CPA, approach side, and conflict angle. Participants estimated the intruder's location at, and its time to, CPA. Effects on three estimation error measures were explored: intruder's miss distance at CPA, orientation at CPA, and time to CPA.

We found that the textual interface allows users to better control the analysis of details of the data through the use of rich, powerful, and flexible commands while the visual interface allows better discovery of new attacks by offering an overview of the current state of the network.

The remaining 17% of alerts were equally divided between misses and false alarms, of large and small magnitude. Roughly half the pilots depended on automation to improve estimation of miss distance relative to the baseline pilots, who viewed identical trials without the aid of automated alerts. Moreover, they did so more on the more difficult traffic trials resulting in improved performance on the 83% correct automation trials without causing harm on the 17% automation-error trials, compared to the baseline group.

However, much less research has been done on modeling air traffic controllers\u2019 attentional processes and visual performance. Yet, such efforts are becoming increasingly critical in the light of changing tasks and task environments of controllers and increasing amounts of traffic under their responsibility. This paper will consider the SEEV (Salience, Effort, Expectancy, Value) model of visual attention allocation by Wickens and collaborators, which is an extension of Senders\u2019 and Carbonell\u2019s original model, as it is applied to air traffic control (ATC). The SEEV model integrates a comprehensive set of features influencing visual attention allocation and is thus an attractive candidate for modeling also air traffic controllers\u2019 behavior and performance. We discuss many unique characteristics of ATC and focus on three particular challenges to applying the SEEV model to ATC tasks presented in the literature: uncertainty, time pressure and workload.",

The experiments modeled two scenarios where AD would have dire effect on controller performance and system safety, a final sequencing task in Experiment 1 and a conflict resolution task in Experiment 2. The independent variables were same in both experiments: Four levels of AD were employed, a 150 ms delay, representing the present analog system, 250 ms, 350 ms, and 1,000 ms delay. The last condition represented the maximum delay associated with the system. Two levels of random pilot delay(PD) were also employed, zero delay and realistic delay. The zero delay condition allowed investigation of the impact of the different AD levels in isolation, while the random PD condition represented a realistic communication environment. Eight experienced controllers participated in both experiments."

This ability was manifested in estimation accuracy of three continuous variables: miss distance at closest point of approach, time to closest point of approach, and orientation at closest point of approach. Twenty-four licensed pilots viewed a series of dynamic encounters on a 2-D CDTI. The scenarios varied widely in their difficulty, influenced by horizontal conflict geometry (conflict angle, speed, miss distance at closest approach of approach, and distance and time till closest point of approach). Pilots were asked to estimate the point and time of closest approach at varying times before that point was reached. The results indicated that (1) decreased estimation accuracy was associated with conflicts that occurred with slower speeds, a longer time into the future, and a longer distance into the future; (2) a tendency for pilots' judgments often to be conservative, judging that conflicts were both more risky and would occur sooner than was actually the case; and (3) a 'distance-overspeed' bias, such that two aircraft viewed farther apart and converging rapidly were perceived as less risky than two aircraft that were closer and converging slower, even though the time till a conflict occurred was identical. Finally, the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the biases observed in this study are discussed."

Verifiably accurate techniques for aircraft mode detection are critical in order to enable the accurate projection of aircraft conflicts, and for the enactment of altitude separation resolution strategies. The introduction of a hybrid formalism encompassing hidden Markov modeling enables us to tune the discrete and continuous parameters of a stochastic hybrid hidden Markov model (HHMM) in order to perform mode detection upon actual flight track data. Two different formats of air traffic data are used to tune the models, allowing for the refinement of the differential equations governing the HHMM, thereby leading to an increased resolution capability, and resulting in a decreased latency for mode detection.

While these measures yield a reasonably detailed picture of events in a sector during the recording period, there is a substantial gap between them and measures of real interest, for example, measures of sector complexity and controller workload, situation awareness, and performance. Hence, although vast amounts of objective data are potentially available from operational ATC system, derivation of valid, reliable, and meaningful measures from them remains a problem. This problem is particularly pronounced when variables of interest are not directly measurable, such as controller workload and performance. This project represents an emphatically systematic and comprehensive approach to the measurement problem in ATC. The project involved many subtasks. The body of literature on ATC research was organized into taxonomy of ATC measures. Development of criteria for POWER measures was approached in the larger context of establishing and validating theoretical links between direct and indirect measures, facilitated by the measures taxonomy. Evaluation and validation of POWER measures was performed by analysis of data from three sectors at Indianapolis center (ZID). Development and validation of new measures involved an experiment using a part-task ATC simulation and POWER output from data from Kansas City center (ZKC\u00a0\u2026",

Yet, such scenarios are entirely plausible and even likely, particularly in busy airspaces. However, it is also likely that an a controller will seek to implement a resolution that is different from what the pilots had planned, resulting in confusion, delays, and safety risks. This paper examines pilots' and controllers' maneuver preferences and potential sources for dissonance in conflict resolution situations. Data on pilots' maneuver tendencies were gathered from an extensive review of past literature; controllers' preferences were obtained from an experiment that systematically manipulated simulated ATC scenario difficulty and conflict geometries.

The results clearly support the hypothesis and imply that controller workload in terms of time pressure could be determined by momentary conflict geometries between aircraft pairs in a sector. Similarity of results between the groups has implications on both our understanding of controller expertise and on experimental research on air traffic control-related issues.",

Instead of focusing on mean performance, the effects of taskload on the distributions of performance variables are examined. From such data, probabilities of given levels of performance can be derived and methods of measurement that expand the analyses beyond those of the mean developed. Results from two experiments, one abstract, the other realistic, are presented in terms of timely performance on required tasks. As taskload increased, the participants were less likely to act on the experimental tasks at an earliest opportunity than under low taskload, resulting in increase of \u201ctoo late\u201d errors. Measurement of taskload and performance in temporal terms also allowed for bracketing and making inferences about mental workload, which is not directly measurable.",

A review of 19 studies from the past 56 years that have investigated transfer of training effectiveness from ground trainers to airplane revealed, however, that unambiguous conclusions about the best use of these devices are difficult to discern. The reason for the lack of valid data and widely varied results are the large number of intervening variables present in flight training as well as the difficulty of conducting sound research on this topic.",

The incremental transfer effectiveness ratio (ITER) determines the transfer effectiveness of successive increments of training in the ground trainer. Previous research on a personal computer based aviation training device (PCATD) has shown that this device is effective for teaching instrument tasks (Taylor et al., 1996; 1999). In a later study as predicted by the incremental transfer of training theory of Roscoe (1971)., the greatest transfer of training effect was found for the group that received five hours compared to 10 and 15 hours of prior PCATD training in an airplane (Taylor et al., 2002b). In some cases the results indicate a complex pattern supporting the notion that more training in a PCATD is not necessarily better. The research reported here sought to replicate the previous findings by Taylor et al.(1996, 1999, 2002b) using both PCATDs and flight training devices (FTDs).Participants in this experiment were assigned to four flight training device (FTD) groups, one PCATD group, and a control (airplane) group. Training in the FTD was conducted in Frasca 141, level-1 FTDs. The PCATD training was conducted using FAA approved PCATDs from Aviation Teachware Technologies (ELITE) v. 6.0. 2, with flight controls by Precision Flight Controls.

A part-task experimental simulation that presented the participating controllers with several simultaneous tasks in four quadrants, or panes, on a single display was used. Only one pane and typically one task could be viewed at a time. This allowed for measurement of controllers\u2019 attention to each task. All events unfolding in the experimental scenarios and controllers\u2019 actions were recorded and timed as well. From these data, several dependent variables were derived, focusing on the temporal aspects of controllers\u2019 performance and their prioritization of simultaneously available tasks. The results indicate that taskload was manipulated successfully and resulted in measurable differences between experimental conditions in both taskload and performance, the latter evinced by the time elapsed in a window of opportunity for a given task before action was taken on it as well as time remaining in the window of opportunity when action was completed. However, it appears that either the controllers were not aware of these temporal features of their tasks or that other factors dominated their prioritization decisions. Task prioritization may hence be driven by task characteristics that are categorical rather\u00a0\u2026",

Older pilots may especially benefit from such aids because of agerelated declines in working memory, although cognitive declines may impair the ability to coordinate the use of these aids with concurrent flight navigation and control tasks. We investigated the use of two external aids that may vary in ease of coordination: a conventional knee pad and an electronic notepad, or e-pad. Participants were 6 older (50-65 years) and 6 younger (20-40) active instrument-rated pilots. While in a Frasca flight simulator, they listened to and read back complex (four-instruction) ATC messages while using the kneepad, e-pad, or no aid. Readback accuracy was analyzed by an Age x Aid x Instruction type (Heading, Altitude, Speed) ANOVA with Aid and Instruction as repeated measures. Accuracy was higher when pilots used either aid compared to no aid, and lower for older pilots. The findings suggested a greater aid benefit for older pilots, with a smaller age difference in the two aid conditions than in the no-aid condition. While the Age x Aid interaction was not significant, this interaction was significant for the altitude instruction readbacks. Despite the small sample size, our study replicates note-taking (kneepad) benefits for older as well as younger pilots\u2019 communication, and extends these findings to the novel epad. Results of a usability survey helped improve the e-pad interface. We will next investigate potential attentional costs of these aids for task coordination during simulated Frasca flight, as well as\u00a0\u2026"

The data of these pilots were compared with a matched \u201cbaseline\u201d pilots, who viewed identical trials without the aid of automated alerts. Roughly half the pilots depended on and benefited from this automation, and others did not. Those who benefited did so when problems were difficult but not when they were easy. Furthermore, automation benefits were observed only when automation was correct, but automation costs were not observed when it was in error. While assisting miss distance prediction, the automation led to an underestimate of the time remaining till the point of closest approach.",

        "description": "Many recent initiatives involving social psychology applications in the aviation world have redoubled the interest in the concept of teams and teamwork. The importance of teamwork in airline cockpits, hailed as cockpit (or crew-) resource management (CRM), has been recognized for a relatively long time. It is also widely agreed that extensive and effective interaction among participants in the National Airspace System (NAS), pilots, air traffic controllers, and airline operations personnel, is tantamount to the daily successes of the nation\u2019s air transportation industry. Team aspects in air traffic control (ATC) are, however, much more convoluted than intra-cockpit teams or top-level teamwork between NAS elements. The ATC system involves a complicated network of facilities, technology, and personnel, which all must interact synergistically, often under time pressure, to ensure safe, efficient, and orderly flow of air traffic. It is perhaps due to this complexity that there has been a significant deficiency in research activity relating to teamwork in ATC. Yet, inadequate coordination between controllers has been considered a causal factor in a substantial proportion of low to moderate severity operational errors. Furthermore, automation tools developed for controllers are primarily focused on supporting the individual controller, while many, if not all of ATC functions are a team effort. In this paper we review the literature relevant to the team concept in the ATC domain, identify and characterize the different teams controllers belong to either simultaneously (eg, intra-and inter-facility teams) or in different operational environments, and catalog the results from\u00a0\u2026",

The treatment effect on the IPC# 1 and IPC# 2 pass/fail ratios were not statistically significant.

The PCATD group was compared to the Airplane group and to the FTD group, the Airplane group to the FTD group.

This paper reports analysis of ATC voice data obtained from three different sectors at the Indianapolis air route traffic control center (ZID ARTCC). The main purpose of this analysis was to examine how different sector characteristics and the busy and slow periods within the sectors differed explicitly in terms of pilot-controller communications and implicitly in terms of controller taskload and workload. Measures derived from the voice data were also compared to metrics reflecting ATC sector complexity that were derived from the output of the objective activity and taskload assessment program, POWER, developed by the FAA.",

        "description": "The current POWER \u201csuite\u201d of air traffic control (ATC) metrics includes such measures as traffic count, control duration, and variability in aircraft headings, altitudes, and speeds, as well as latencies of handoff initiation and acceptance, as well as records of a number of different controller activities. While these measures yield a reasonably detailed picture of events in a sector during the recording period, there is a substantial gap between them and measures of real interest, for example, measures of sector complexity and controller workload, situation awareness, and performance. Hence, although vast amounts of objective data are potentially available from operational ATC system, derivation of valid, reliable, and meaningful measures from them remains a problem. This problem is particularly pronounced when variables of interest are not directly measurable, such as controller workload and performance.This project represents an emphatically systematic and comprehensive approach to the measurement problem in ATC. The project involved many subtasks. The body of literature on ATC research was organized into taxonomy of ATC measures. Development of criteria for POWER measures was approached in the larger context of establishing and validating theoretical links between direct and indirect measures, facilitated by the measures taxonomy. Evaluation and validation of POWER measures was performed by analysis of data from three sectors at Indianapolis center (ZID). Development and validation of new measures involved an experiment using a part-task ATC simulation and POWER output from data from Kansas City center (ZKC\u00a0\u2026"

In Experiment 1, the effect of AD was measurable but not statistically significant; PD reduced accuracy and resulted in earlier turn initiations. In Experiment 2, both AD and PD significantly reduced separation between aircrafts. Short communication delays, however, did not substantially degrade controller performance in the experiments.",

Participants' performance was evaluated by the proportion of responses completed within the required window of opportunity as well as the proportion of a window of opportunity that elapsed before the onset of a response.

An 83% reliability level of automated conflict detection that was chosen, simulated the sort of unreliability that might be characteristic of such a system, predicting conflicts with longer look-ahead-times, in a probabilistic airspace, subject to turbulence, uncertainty, and future pilot control actions between the time of alert and the time of closest approach with the conflicting traffic.24 licensed pilots viewed a series of dynamic encounters on a 2D CDTI that varied widely in their difficulty, as influenced by lateral conflict geometry (conflict angle, speed, and distance & time till closest approach). Pilots were asked to estimate the point and time of closest approach at varying times before that point was reached. A 3-level alert system provided a correct categorical estimate of the projected miss distance on 83% of the trials. The remaining 17% of alerts were equally divided between automation misses and false alarms, of large and small magnitude. The data of these pilots were compared with a matched sample of \u201cbaseline\u201d pilots who viewed identical trials without the aid of automated alerts.The results revealed that roughly half the pilots depended on automation, and used it to improve their performance (accurate estimation of miss distance) relative to the baseline pilots who did not receive the automation.

However, inferences about future trajectories of ownship and traffic made by the CDTI logic will, by nature, be imperfect, leading to an apparent loss of reliability of the prediction/planning tools. This loss of reliability and its impact on pilots\u2019 behavior and cognition is the focus of this report. Three specific aspects of the CDTI are distinguished: Alerts, visual symbology, and planning tools.The report draws from general human factors literature. The tradeoff between false alarms (FAs) and misses (or late alerts), how these tradeoffs affect trust and reliance in the alerting system, and how low base-rate events necessarily create a high false alarm rate (FAR), if highcost misses are to be minimized, are examined. The report concludes with general recommendations emerging from the literature on solutions to mitigate the problems of FAs, with an emphasis on multi-level alerts. Also literature that has addressed the FA\u2013late alert tradeoff and evaluated the CDTI alerts with pilot-in-the-loop (PIL) data was reviewed. Lessons learned from implementation of Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) were assessed and results of the analysis of ASRS reports from TCAS system are reported. From this review, guidance will emerge regarding what aspects of conflict situations make detection and response difficult from a pilot\u2019s point of view, and therefore should be targeted for inclusion in certification and approval.

        "description": "Automated warning and alert devices such as airborne collision avoidance systems (ACASs) represent a class of automation that is often found to be imperfect. The imperfections can be expressed as the number of false alarms or missed events. Most ACASs are constructed with a bias to prevent misses (which may have catastrophic consequences) and therefore, coupled with a low base-rate of conflict events, create high false alarm rates. In this paper, we review the adequacy of various CDTI warning algorithms that have been proposed and tested in addressing the false alarm issue, and the potential for multiple levels of alerting to mitigate the effects of false alarms on trust and reliance on the CDTI. We suggest new directions for future research, including evaluating the effects of false alarm rates on pilots' use of the CDTI, determining what strategies may enhance pilot tolerance of false alarms, and investigating\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "A task analysis for a typical air traffic control conflict detection scenario is described. Two types of prediction components are identified,(1) a relative judgment (RJ) task with regard to which aircraft will reach the projected point of intersection first, and (2) a prediction-motion (PM) task estimating the time-to-collide if the aircraft will reach the intersection simultaneously. Also identified are several alternative strategies that can be potentially used by controllers to perform the RJ and PM tasks. Following the task analysis, a literature review on factors influencing the RJ and PM performance reveals that although there are a number of studies on controller performance in conflict detection, almost no one has studied how the controller actually performs the RJ and PM tasks. Finally, a number of potential research questions are proposed with an aim to shed new light on the human attention/cognition mechanisms involved in the prediction tasks in ATC and hopefully contribute to the knowledge base regarding motion prediction involving multiple objects or multiple tasks.",

Three experiments were conducted to ascertain the nature of drift in reciprocal aiming tasks and to develop methods and measures to isolate and quantify drift for analyses. We also evaluated a computational posture-based model of reaching movements with respect to the findings of the experiments. Drift was observed in all three experiments, generally toward the middle of the joint motility range. Simulations based on the model produced drift to the middle of the task movement range rather than middle of the joint movement range. Adding noise to the model could increase its power for simulating the underlying principles of movement control as reflected in\u00a0\u2026",

Two types of training devices were tested: 1) an FAA approved PCATD; and 2) a Frasca 141 FTD. An Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC) was given to all subjects in the airplane to establish a performance baseline (IPC #1). After the completion of IPC #1 in the airplane, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups: the PCATD, the FTD, the aircraft or the control group with a balancing constraint so that the subjects successfully completing IPC #1 were equally distributed among the four groups. During the six-month period, each subject received two recency of experience flights of about 1.8 hours each in either the PCATD, the FTD or the aircraft; the control group received no recency training. These recency of experience flights included three instrument approaches, holding procedures, and intercepting and tracking navigation radials and courses. After the six-month period, performance on an IPC in the airplane (IPC #2) compared pilots who received recency of experience in the training devices to a control group. The subjects in the PCATD and FTD group were also compared to the aircraft group who received recency of experience in the airplane. A comparison of the three training groups with the control group performance on the final instrument proficiency check indicated that the training groups performed significantly better than the control group.

The recency of experience requirements may be conducted in an airplane or simulated in an approved flight training device (FTD). If an instrument pilot fails to meet recency of experience requirements within a 12-month period, an instrument proficiency check (IPC) must be accomplished with a certified flight instructor, instrument (CFII) to regain instrument currency. This project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of a personal computer aviation training device (PCATD) and a FTD in conducting an IPC. The study will compare the performance of pilots receiving an IPC in a PCATD, in a FTD or in an airplane (IPC# 1) with performance on an IPC in an airplane (IPC# 2). This comparison between a PCATD and an airplane will investigate the effectiveness of the PCATD in administering an IPC. Currently, the PCATD is not approved for IPCs. The IPC requirements are indicated in the Instrument Pilot Practical Test Standards (US Dept. of Transportation, 1998). The comparison between a Frasca and the airplane will determine whether the current rule to permit IPCs in a FTD is warranted. Finally, the performance of pilots receiving IPC# 1 in an airplane will be compared with IPC# 2 in an airplane with a second CFII. This comparison will permit the determination of the reliability of IPCs conducted in an airplane."

The current air traffic control automation efforts are based on time-based metering of arrivals to major airports in the National Airspace System (NAS). Such metering systems assist controllers and air traffic managers by extending the prediction and projection horizons beyond to what is within the capabilities of unaided human cognition and provide through a number of different interfaces early warnings of excessive demand and feedback on the effect of various responses. However, the procedures to manage excessive demand are difficult to administer and result in compounding delays and wasted resources. This paper describes an algorithm that computes customized transition trajectories for aircraft approaching a designated runway in a manner that ensures minimum regulatory separation between successive aircraft. Putative benefits of the algorithm include maximal use of available resources, dynamic transitions between free and controlled flight, and reallocation of functions between human controllers and automated systems."

The first is concerned with assessing the effects implementing advanced ATC concepts, such as Free Flight, on controller performance, whereas the second is concerned with determining how automated tools can help controllers ensure that this performance is not negatively affected by the implementation of such concepts themselves. In both instances, a systematic evaluation process is required to make such assessments. Such evaluations however, have traditionally proven to be an arduous task given the relative difficulty of selecting the appropriate performance measure to effectively answer the research question being addressed. This paper tackles this problem by providing an evolving taxonomy of ATC performance measures. The goal of providing this taxonomy is to help researchers more easily identify and apply the relevant measurement techniques during empirical investigation.",

The dependent measures were trials to specific completion standards, time to complete a flight lesson and time to a successful evaluation flight. The paper describes how percent transfer, transfer effectiveness ratios (TER) and incremental transfer effectiveness ratios (ITER) were computed for each instrument task and for the time to complete a flight lesson. The data indicate that the PCATD is effective in teaching basic and advanced instrument tasks to private pilots, which replicated the findings of an earlier study. As a result of prior training in a PCATD, trials, time to complete the flight lesson and time to a successful evaluation flight were less when compared to an airplane Control group. Overall, the greatest effect was found for the PCATD 5 group, which was predicted by the incremental transfer of training theory of Roscoe.",

        "description": "Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data has proven invaluable in accident and incident analysis to determine the aircraft states and crew actions in abnormal or emergency situations. With advanced technology the quality and quantity of such data have substantially improved, and these data have also become more accessible than before. Consequently, a number of participating airlines have begun to routinely analyze the flight data from regular flights within Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) programs to identify patterns of irregularities and potentially hazardous situations (Brandt, 1999). Objective FDR data could also be particularly valuable in training and pilot performance assessment for research purposes, where accurate quantitative data could not be obtained otherwise.Although the current FDRs provide a wealth of data that can be efficiently handled and stored, information extraction from these data is hampered by the lack of proven performance measures. For example, only when predetermined parameter values are exceeded are they automatically flagged in the FOQA data; but a detailed analysis of these instances must be done manually. Because manual analysis of the FDR data is labor-intensive and time consuming, it may not be carried out in appropriate detail, and much useful information is thus lost.",

Particularly in Palm Beach County, Florida, several display design principles were violated on the ballot, leading to problems for the diverse population using it. This demonstration presents a new system designed to decrease the number of voting errors and facilitate an efficient tallying system, further reducing errors in the counting process.

This is exemplified in web accessible \u201cportals\u201d, which grant users access to multiple information sources through a single web page. These \u201cportals\u201d include not only the familiar Yahoo\u00ae-like web sites, but also corporate intranets and scientific workspaces. The basic problem facing all such implementations is that too much information is presented on insufficient screen space. The result is information delivery interfaces, which are confusing, overwhelming, and often so full of information that it is difficult for a user to locate the data they seek. The second major problem with web-based information portals is that the amount of user preferences they support is minimal. At best, one can choose their page elements, which column they reside in, and a possible color set. The intent of this demonstration is to present a better way of managing multiple web-accessible information sources within a single, highly customizable interface that utilizes the principles of web-based application interface design. The demonstration will consist of an online interactive tutorial. The tutorial will first point out flaws within current web-based information management systems by allowing a user to manipulate these systems and offering explanations of why certain elements in their interfaces are insufficient for proper information handling.

The experiment compared the flight performance of four groups after a six-month period between instrument proficiency check (IPC) flights. The control group received no training to maintain currency in this period. Three other groups received training in either the PCATD, the Frasca, or the aircraft. Preliminary results for 106 subjects are presented. The performance of the subjects on an initial evaluation flight test and a final proficiency flight test six months later were compared. All subjects were instrument current by FAA standards prior to the evaluation flight test. Fortytwo percent of the 106 subjects passed the evaluation flight test while 52 percent passed\u00a0\u2026",

Considering this, the visual fields of 13 subjects were measured concurrently under three levels of mental workload using a Goldmann visual perimeter. Tone counting tasks were employed to induce mental workload, avoiding interference with visual performance. Various methods of shape measurement and analysis were used to investigate the variation of the shape of the visual field as a function of mental load. As expected, the mean area of visual fields reduced to 92.2% in the medium workload condition and to 86.41% under heavy workload, compared to light load condition. This tunnelling effect was not uniform, but resulted in statistically significant shape distortion as well, as measured by the majority of the 12 shape indices used here.

Second, performance criteria must be chosen and appropriate statistical models developed to evaluate the predictive power of the screening tasks. However, in spatial and mathematical reasoning tasks it may be inappropriate to regard differences among scores as representing simply graded differences in performance, rather there are distinct subgroups within some populations. Mixed regression models, which estimate several regression functions within the same data set, offer an alternative approach. (Author)"

The purpose of this study was to determine the just noticeable difference (JND) in regularity for two polygonal figures, a pentagon and an octagon, which mimicked polar graphic safety parameter displays. It was hypothesized that the subjects would be able to detect smaller deviations from a regular shape in an octagon, which is more redundant than a pentagon. Additionally, it was hypothesized that outward deviations would be better detected than inward deviations, as well as deviations along vertices close to the edges of the computer screen. All these issues have implications in display design.Two experiments were conducted. Eight graduate students volunteered as subjects in both experiments. The stimuli were presented on a computer screen and the subjects indicated whether the shape presented was regular or irregular by pressing the appropriate key on the keyboard. In Experiment 1 the independent variables were the type of the polygon (octagon or pentagon), direction of deviation of a vertex (inward or outward), and the magnitude of the deviation (1, 3, and 6%). The response variables were the hit rate, a sensitivity measure d\u2019, criterion measure \u03b2, and the reaction time. Only the deviation magnitude had a statistically significant effect on performance, but the scale used (1, 3, and 6% deviations) proved to be too coarse for accurate determination of the JND.",

        "description": "Although the term situation awareness is fairly new, air traffic controllers have always been familiar with the concept. Controllers refer to their situation awareness as the\" picture\", either\" having the picture\" or\" losing the picture\". The current definitions of situation awareness (eg, Endsley, cited in Garland, Phillips, Tilden, and Wise, 1991) quite accurately describe the demands of air traffic control (ATC) as well, and make the controller's picture synonymous with situation awareness. In the following text, the terms\" picture\" and\" situation awareness\" are used interchangeably. The air traffic controller's memory is very important in ATC in general, but especially in the maintenance of the controller's picture. Because of the nature of the job and the environment in which controllers work, their dynamic memory in particular has a central role in updating the picture. There is, however, very little research done on the relationships between the controllers picture, dynamic memory, and workload, all of which are 0 fundamental concepts of ATC. This paper will attempt to suggest some of these relationships and raise questions about the role of the dynamic memory in the air traffic controller's situation awareness.",

We define conflict as the potential loss of separation between two aircraft, or a situation where two aircraft would lose separation at some time in the future should they continue on their present trajectories. Consider two aircraft flying at the same altitude on converging courses. Determining whether these aircraft will violate lateral separation requires the integration of speed and distance information to predict the distance or time between the aircraft at the point of intersection of their trajectories (Law et al., 1993; Loft, Neal, & Humphreys, 2007; Neal & Kwantes, 2009). When aircraft are also changing altitude (especially in approach control), the prediction of loss of separation in the future also requires the integration of the vertical speeds and altitudes of aircraft, and the subsequent computation of whether the difference between aircraft altitudes at the time of the position overlap on the lateral plane are below a minimum separation (Stankovic, Loft, Rantanen, & Ponomarenko, in press; Xu & Rantanen, 2003). Several theoretical accounts of how controllers detect conflicts have been published (Loft, Bolland, Humphreys & Neal, 2009; Rantanen & Nunes, 2005; Stankovic, Raufaste, & Averty, 2008).In empirical studies of conflict detection, researchers have typically either asked controllers to assess the risk of conflict between aircraft or to estimate the likelihood that they would intervene on a given aircraft pair to assure separation, but there has been little consideration of\u00a0\u2026"

Team aspects in air traffic control (ATC) are, however, much more convoluted than intra-cockpit teams or top-level teamwork between NAS elements.

Entry could occur only within a discrete window of opportunity, represented visually by a target range within a variable-speed progress bar. Participants could view only one task at a time, thus performance required scanning and sampling of all four tasks. Sampling behavior (mouse movements to the vicinity of one of the four tasks) was manipulated via access effort; blocks of trials presented either a half or full second lag before a target task would become visible. Participants\u2019 performance was evaluated by the proportion of responses completed within the required window of opportunity as well as the proportion of a window of opportunity that elapsed before the onset of a response. Results indicate a decrease in such performance as a result of display lag manipulation. The potential for the use of this paradigm in developing predictive measures of performance is discussed."

Also identified are several alternative strategies that can be potentially used by controllers to perform the RJ and PM tasks. Following the task analysis, a literature review on factors influencing the RJ and PM performance reveals that although there are a number of studies on controller performance in conflict detection, almost no one has studied how the controller actually performs the RJ and PM tasks. Finally, a number of potential research questions are proposed with an aim to shed new light on the human attention/cognition mechanisms involved in\u00a0\u2026"

        "description": "Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data has proven invaluable in accident and incident analysis to determine the aircraft states and crew actions in abnormal or emergency situations. With advanced technology the quality and quantity of such data have substantially improved, and these data have also become more accessible than before. Consequently, a number of participating airlines have begun to routinely analyze the flight data from regular flights within Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) programs to identify patterns of irregularities and potentially hazardous situations (Brandt, 1999). Objective FDR data could also be particularly valuable in training and pilot performance assessment for research purposes, where accurate quantitative data could not be obtained otherwise.Although the current FDRs provide a wealth of data that can be efficiently handled and stored, information extraction from these data is\u00a0\u2026"

        "description": "An incremental transfer of training research design was used to measure the effectiveness of a PCATD and to determine the point at which additional training in a PCATD was no longer effective. The dependent measures were trials to specific completion standards, time to complete a flight lesson and time to a successful evaluation flight. Percent transfer, transfer effectiveness ratios (TER) and incremental transfer effectiveness ratios (ITER) were computed for each instrument task and for the time to complete a flight lesson. The data indicate that the PCATD is effective in teaching basic and advanced instrument tasks to private pilots, which replicated the findings of an earlier study by Taylor and colleagues. As a result of prior training in a PCATD, trials, time to complete the flight lesson and time to a successful evaluation flight were less when compared to an airplane Control group. Overall, the greatest effect was\u00a0\u2026"

A basic taxonomy of measure types is also presented where objective measures are classified distinguishing between direct measures, derivative metrics based on these, and indirect measures of unobservable constructs and phenomena. The recent development of novel objective measures and their ability to predict and classify pilot performance will also be reported."

        "description": "We explored the effects of conflict geometry on pilot conflict understanding, manifested in estimation accuracy of three continuous variables: miss distance, time to closest point of approach, and orientation at the closest point of approach. Results indicated (a) increased difficulty of understanding with conflicts that occurred with slower speeds, a longer time into the future, and a longer distance into the future;(b) a tendency for pilots\u2019 judgments often to be conservative, judging that conflicts were both more risky and would occur sooner than was actually the case; and (c) a \u201cdistance-over-speed\u201d bias, such that two aircraft viewed farther apart and converging rapidly were perceived as less risky than two aircraft that were closer to each other and converging at a slower rate, even though the time until a conflict occurred was identical.INTRODUCTION Given the importance of conflict detection with the CDTI in free flight and its under-representation in research, the present study investigated the effects of conflict geometry on pilots\u2019 conflict awareness using a CDTI. Dependent variables were estimate errors of the above-described continuous measures of conflict risk (TCPA, MD, and OCPA). The goals of this experiment were to identify the features that would make unaided conflict detection difficult or easy and to identify the biases that would affect estimation performance."

        "description": "Means of communication between pilots and controllers is one of the fundamental principles of air traffic control (ATC). Consequently, air-ground communications will both reflect the taskload imposed on the controller as well as drive the workload experienced by the controller. Therefore, analysis of ATC communications could potentially reveal a very rich and detailed picture of the demands placed on a controller in a given sector and traffic situation. This paper reports analysis of ATC voice data obtained from three different sectors at the Indianapolis air route traffic control center (ZID ARTCC). The main purpose of this analysis was to examine how different sector characteristics and the busy and slow periods within the sectors differed explicitly in terms of pilot-controller communications and implicitly in terms of controller taskload and workload. Measures derived from the voice data were also compared to metrics reflecting ATC sector complexity that were derived from the output of the objective activity and taskload assessment program, POWER, developed by the FAA."
