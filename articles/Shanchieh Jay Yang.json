However, preparation of their content is time-consuming and requires experts to provide detailed specifications. In this paper, we explore the challenges of automated generation of the content (composed of scenarios and terrains) for these environments. We propose new models to represent the cybersecurity domain and associated action spaces. These models are used to create sound and complex training content based on partial specifications provided by users. We compare the results with a real-world complex malware campaign to assess the realism of the synthesized content. To further evaluate the correctness and variability of the results, we utilize the kill-chain attack graph generation for the generated training content to asses the internal correspondence of its key components.Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can create complex training content similar to advanced attack campaigns, which passes evaluation for soundness and practicality. Our proposed approach and its implementation significantly contribute to the state of the art, enabling novel approaches to cybersecurity training and autonomous system development."

The interpretation of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be challenging for cybersecurity practitioners due to presumed expertise, complex dependencies, and inherent ambiguity. Meanwhile, advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to recent surge in studies exploring its uses in cybersecurity operations. This leads us to question how well encoder-only (e.g., RoBERTa) and decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3.5) LLMs can comprehend and summarize TTPs to inform analysts of the intended purposes (i.e., tactics) of a cyberattack procedure. The state-of-the-art LLMs have shown to be prone to hallucination by providing inaccurate information, which is problematic in critical domains like cybersecurity. Therefore, we propose the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to extract relevant contexts for each cyberattack procedure for decoder-only LLMs (without fine-tuning). We further contrast such approach against supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of encoder-only LLMs. Our results reveal that both the direct-use of decoder-only LLMs (i.e., its pre-trained knowledge) and the SFT of encoder-only LLMs offer inaccurate interpretation of cyberattack procedures. Significant improvements are shown when RAG is used for decoder-only LLMs, particularly when directly relevant context is found. This study further sheds insights on the limitations and capabilities of using RAG for LLMs in interpreting TTPs.",

The MITRE AT&CK framework employs Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to describe how and why attackers exploit vulnerabilities. However, a TTP description written by one security professional can be interpreted very differently by another, leading to confusion in cybersecurity operations or even business, policy, and legal decisions. Meanwhile, advancements in AI have led to the increasing use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to assist the various tasks in cyber operations. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP tasks have significantly improved because of the LLM's semantic understanding and scalability. This leads us to question how well LLMs can interpret TTP or general cyberattack descriptions. We propose and analyze the direct use of LLMs as well as training BaseLLMs with ATT&CK descriptions to study their capability in predicting ATT&CK tactics. Our results reveal that the BaseLLMs with supervised training provide a more focused and clearer differentiation between the ATT&CK tactics (if such differentiation exists). On the other hand, LLMs offer a broader interpretation of cyberattack techniques. Despite the power of LLMs, inherent ambiguity exists within their predictions. We thus summarize the existing challenges and recommend research directions on LLMs to deal with the inherent ambiguity of TTP descriptions.",

The proposed attack modeling approach admits a large class of non-deterministic attack policies and enables the characterization of system safety as an asymptotic property. By calculating the maximal safe set, the resulting new impact metrics intuitively quantify the degradation of safety and the impact of cyber attacks on the safety properties of the system under attack.

This work develops HeAT (Heated Alert Triage): given a critical indicator of compromise (IoC), e.g., a severe IDS alert, HeAT produces a HeATed Attack Campaign (HAC) depicting the multistage activities that led up to the critical event. We define the concept of \"Alert Episode Heat\" to represent the analysts opinion of how much an event contributes to the attack campaign of the critical IoC given their knowledge of the network and security expertise. Leveraging a network-agnostic feature set, HeAT learns the essence of analyst's assessment of \"HeAT\" for a small set of IoC's, and applies the learned model to extract insightful attack campaigns for IoC's not seen before, even across networks by transferring what have been learned. We demonstrate the capabilities of HeAT with data collected in Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) and through collaboration with a real-world SOC. We developed HeAT-Gain metrics to demonstrate how analysts may assess and benefit from the extracted attack campaigns in comparison to common practices where IP addresses are used to corroborate evidences. Our results demonstrates the practical uses of HeAT by finding campaigns that span across diverse attack stages, remove a significant volume of irrelevant alerts, and achieve coherency to the analyst's original assessments."

An attack graph is a graphical representation of attacker strategies that shows all the pathways an attacker can use to penetrate a network. Existing techniques correlate system vulnerabilities and expert input regarding network topology to construct attack graphs, thus providing a static and hypothetical view of the threat landscape. These traditional attack graphs cannot directly be used to monitor ongoing attacks in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) since they do not show the dynamic strategies being employed by the attackers. Meanwhile, SOC analysts defend against cyber attacks by monitoring millions of intrusion alerts on a daily basis 2, often leading to \u2018alert fatigue\u2019and reduced productivity. In the accepted paper [1], we propose a novel paradigm of attack graphs, known as \u2018alert-driven attack graphs\u2019, that are learned directly from intrusion alerts without any expert input. Thus, instead of investigating large volumes of alerts, SOC analysts can visualize a few alert-driven attack graphs to understand the corresponding attacker strategies. Utilizing machine learning to extract alert-driven attack graphs, the following constraints must be addressed: 1) Alert-type imbalance: Severe alerts are infrequent, while non-severe alerts (eg, related to network scans) are common. Frequency-analysis methods discard infrequent events as noise, making most machine learning methods unsuitable for this application. 2) Modeling context: The same alert signature may be involved in different\u00a0\u2026"

Existing research on countering this menace is only effective for pivoting activities spanning within the internal network perimeter. When applying existing methods to include external traffic, the detection algorithm produces overwhelming entries, most of which unrelated to pivoting. We address this problem by identifying the major characteristics that are specific to potentially malicious pivoting. Our analysis combines human expertise with machine learning and is based on the inspection of real network traffic generated by a large organization. The final goal is the reduction of the unacceptable amounts of false positives generated by the state of the art methods.

The discovery and detection of attacks, though needing continuous efforts, is no longer sufficient. Security Operation Center (SOC) analysts are overwhelmed by the significant volume of intrusion alerts without being able to extract actionable intelligence. Recognizing this challenge, this paper describes the advances and findings through deploying ASSERT to process intrusion alerts from OmniSOC in collaboration with the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research (CACR) at Indiana University. ASSERT utilizes information theoretic unsupervised learning to extract and update `attack models' in near real-time without expert knowledge. It consumes streaming intrusion alerts and generates a small number of statistical models for SOC analysts to comprehend ongoing and emerging attacks in a timely manner. This paper presents the architecture and key processes of ASSERT and discusses a few real-world attack models to highlight the use-cases that benefit SOC operations. The research team is developing a light-weight containerized ASSERT that will be shared through a public repository to help the community combat the overwhelming intrusion alerts.",

So much so that organizations employ teams of security professionals just to keep up with vast amount of data presented to the analysts each day. This work develops HeAT (Heated Alert Triage): given a critical indicator of compromise (IoC) such as a severe IDS alert, HeAT produces a HeATed Attack Campaign depicting the actions that led up to the critical event including reconnaissance and initial exploitation stages. We define the concept of \u201cAlert Episode Heat\" to represent the analysts opinion of how much an event contributes to the attack campaign of the critical IoC given their own knowledge of their network context and security expertise. Leveraging a network-agnostic feature set and a short but targeted training process, HeAT is able to realize insightful and concise attack campaigns for IoC\u2019s not observed before, compare attack strategies of different attackers with the same IoC, and also be applied across networks with the same degree of fidelity. HeAT maintains the analysts original assessment of the specified \u201cHeAT\" regardless of the critical event being assessed or the network topology. We demonstrate the capabilities of HeAT with case studies using cyber-competition datasets to mimic how HeAT would be deployed in practice and assess the HeATed attack campaign from the analyst\u2019s perspective.

Critical alerts occur so infrequently that it can be difficult to determine what surrounding alerts are actually related to them, providing a deep challenge to analysts. What if an analyst could provide a collection of known critical alerts and quickly receive a summary detailing their temporal behaviors within a network as well consistently co-occurring signatures that pre-empt or succeed the critical action? What if this information could be provided in near real time, with no training data, and with the capability to adapt to changing temporal patterns and relationships across signatures? The Concept Learning for Intrusion Event Aggregation in Realtime with Rare co-Occurring Alert signature Discovery (CLEAR-ROAD) answers that question, revealing consistent co-occurrences derived from alerts with similar temporal arrival patterns. Alerts are aggregated, or sequenced, based on their unique and invariant arrival patterns, not external training data. The signature patterns expressed by such temporal activity are then discovered through pattern mining techniques. A constrained databasing approach is used to reduce the number of sequences processed by an average of 90% for individual streams. Case studies are conducted to analyze the co-occurring signatures found across two real world datasets, one from a SOC operation and another from a penetration testing competition.

Understanding the thought processes and behaviors of adversaries is extremely challenging as high profile or even amateur attackers have no incentive to share the trades associated with their illegal activities. One opportunity to observe the actions the adversaries perform is through the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) which generate alerts in the event that suspicious behavior was detected. The alerts raised by these systems typically describe the suspicious actions via the form of attack 'signature', which do not necessarily reveal the true intent of the attacker performing the action. Meanwhile, several high level frameworks exist to describe the sequence or chain of action types an adversary might perform. These frameworks, however, do not connect the action types to observables of standard intrusion detection systems, nor describing the plausible intents of the adversarial actions. To address these gaps, this work proposes the Action-Intent Framework (AIF) to complement existing Cyber Attack Kill Chains and Attack Taxonomies. The AIF defines a set of Action-Intent States (AIS) at two levels of description: the Macro-AIS describes 'what' the attacker is trying to achieve and the Micro-AIS describes \"how\" the intended goal is achieved. A full description of both the Macro is provided along with a set of guiding principals of how the AIS is derived and added to the framework.",

Unfortunately, traditional predictive analytics or machine learning techniques that require training data of known attack strategies are not practical, given the scarcity of representative data and the evolving nature of cyberattacks. This paper describes the design and evaluation of a novel automated system, ASSERT, which continuously synthesizes and separates cyberattack behavior models to enable better prediction of future actions. It takes streaming malicious event evidences as inputs, abstracts them to edge-based behavior aggregates, and associates the edges to attack models, where each represents a unique and collective attack behavior.

However, datasets of true malignant alerts are rare and generally only show one potential attack scenario out of many possible ones. Furthermore, it is difficult to expand the analysis of these alerts through artificial means due to the complexity of feature dependencies within an alert and lack of rare yet critical samples. This work proposes the use of a Mutual Information constrained Generative Adversarial Network as a means to synthesize new alerts from historical data. Histogram Intersection and Conditional Entropy are used to show the performance of this model as well as it's ability to learn intricate feature dependencies. The proposed models are able to capture a much wider domain of alert feature values than standard Generative Adversarial Networks\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "Recreating cyber-attack alert data with a high level of fidelity is challenging due to the intricate interaction between features, non-homogeneity of alerts, and potential for rare yet critical samples. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to effectively learn complex data distributions with the intent of creating increasingly realistic data. This paper presents the application of GANs to cyber-attack alert data and shows that GANs not only successfully learn to generate realistic alerts, but also reveal feature dependencies within alerts. This is accomplished by reviewing the intersection of histograms for varying alert-feature combinations between the ground truth and generated datsets. Traditional statistical metrics, such as conditional and joint entropy, are also employed to verify the accuracy of these dependencies. Finally, it is shown that a Mutual Information constraint on the network can be used to increase the generation of low probability, critical, alert values. By mapping alerts to a set of attack stages it is shown that the output of these low probability alerts has a direct contextual meaning for Cyber Security analysts. Overall, this work provides the basis for generating new cyber intrusion alerts and provides evidence that synthesized alerts emulate critical dependencies from the source dataset.",

However, with the growth of IoT devices deployed in a fixed geographic area, the immunity to interference on the communication increases significantly. Attackers may utilize such situation to jam packet transmission by emitting RF interference signal at the same time when a LoRa end node is sending data to the LoRa gateway. As a consequence, the transmission of the LoRa end node would fail due to collision which would in turn reduce the network performance.

Determining the ECA is a NP-Hard problem due to the combinatorial number of possibilities.

The workshop was held in Prague, Czech Republic, on 18-20 October 2017. There is a growing recognition that future cyber defense should involve extensive use of partially autonomous agents that actively patrol the friendly network, and detect and react to hostile activities rapidly (far faster than human reaction time), before the hostile malware is able to inflict major damage, evade friendly agents, or destroy friendly agents. This requires cyber-defense agents with a significant degree of intelligence, autonomy, self-learning, and adaptability. The report focuses on the following questions: In what computing and tactical environments would such an agent operate? What data would be available for the agent to observe or ingest? What actions would the agent be able to take? How would such an agent plan a complex course of actions? Would the agent learn from its experiences, and how? How would the agent collaborate with humans? How can we ensure that the agent will not take undesirable destructive actions? Is it possible to help envision such an agent with a simple example?",

Unfortunately, most of the time we do not have enough observables of the malicious activities before they are already under way. Therefore, this work suggests to use unconventional signals extracted from various data sources with different time granularities to predict cyber incidents for target entities. A Bayesian network is used to predict cyber attacks where the unconventional signals are used as indicative random variables. This work also develops a novel minority class over sampling technique to improve cyber attack prediction on imbalanced data sets. The results show that depending on the selected time granularity, the unconventional signals are able to predict cyber attacks for the anonimyzed target organization even though the signals are not explicitly related to that organization. Furthermore, the minority over sampling approach developed achieves better performance compared to the existing filtering techniques in the literature.",

This work proposes a cyber-based attacker behavior model (ABM) in conjunction with the Cyber Attack Scenario and Network Defense Simulator to model the interaction between the network and the attackers. The ABM leverages a knowledge-based design and factors in the capability, opportunity, intent, preference, and Cyber Attack Kill Chain integration to model various types of attackers. By varying the types of attackers and the network configurations, and simulating their interactions, we present a method to measure the overall network security against cyber attackers under different scenarios.

While generating signals, auto cross correlation is used to find out the optimum signal aggregation and lead times. Generated signals are used to train a Bayesian classifier against the ground truth of each attack type. We show that it is possible to forecast future cyber incidents using CAPTURE and the consideration of the lead time could improve forecast performance.",

This can represent a security or privacy risk that the users are often unaware of when they simply accept the request. To better understand the behavior of these apps, there exist several static or dynamic analysis tools to extract information such as permission requirement or ratings. However most of them do not examine the sequential resource accesses of the applications which can be critical.

Through analysis of attack data collected from Hackmageddon, correlation was found among reported attack volume in consecutive days. This paper presents a forecasting system that aims to predict the number of cyber attacks on a given day based only on a set of historical attack count data. Our system conducts ARIMA time series forecasting on all previously collected incidents to predict the expected number of attacks on a future date.

The commonly considered independent cascade model, when applied to social networks such as Digg, produces a phase-transition phenomenon where the cascade is either very small or very large. This phenomenon can be explained based on the concept of Giant Propagation Component (GPC). The GPC is defined as a maximally connected component, such that, by applying the independent cascade model, once any node of the component is infected, most of the remaining nodes in the component will eventually become infected with a high probability. While GPC exists in social networks, the phase-transition phenomenon, is not observed in the actual cascade size distribution when the information propagation is due to actions such as ``like'' or ``dig''.

To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner.

        "description": "Facing diverse network attack strategies and overwhelming alters, much work has been devoted to correlate observed malicious events to pre-defined scenarios, attempting to deduce the attack plans based on expert models of how network attacks may transpire. Sophisticated attackers can, however, employ a number of obfuscation techniques to confuse the alert correlation engine or classifier. Recognizing the need for a systematic analysis of the impact of attack obfuscation, this paper models attack strategies as general finite order Markov models, and treats obfuscated observations as noises. Taking into account that only finite observation window and limited computational time can be afforded, this work develops an algorithm to efficiently inference on the joint distribution of clean and obfuscated attack sequences. The inference algorithm recovers the optimal match of obfuscated sequences to attack models\u00a0\u2026",

This work proposes online processing to simultaneously segment traffic observables and generate attack behavior models that are relevant to a target. The goal is not just to aggregate similar attack behaviors, but to provide situational awareness by grouping relevant traffic that exhibits one or more behaviors around each asset. The seemingly clustering problem is recast as a supervised learning problem: classifying received traffic to the most likely attack model, and iteratively introducing new models to explain received traffic.

The amount of data being presented and displayed to the analyst is overwhelming - to a point that in many cases they are missing the salient or key activities of interest. Analysts are spending the majority of their time filtering through the data rather than performing analysis. Over the past 10 years, there has been an increasing emphasis on research in higher level fusion or what many are calling situation awareness. In this paper, we describe a collection of research addressing the challenges of enabling situation awareness. We will review our reference model and provide a discussion of a flow through the model to include how we can rank various activities based on their impact and threat. We also provide a number of algorithms that have been implemented and then tested and evaluated\u00a0\u2026",

A significant enhancement to network defenses will be to recognize the different classes of multistage attacks, allowing timely and effective anticipation of future attacks. Drawing analogies from social networking analysis, this work proposes a methodology that clusters cyber attacks based on the `significant services' being exploited. From transforming the attacked services to utilizing the Divisive Hierarchical Clustering algorithm, the proposed method is able to identify sub-communities of attacks that share common characteristics. Experiment results demonstrate a high modularity for the identified community structure. Novel discoveries are also made possible by examining the attack clusters and the resulting dendrogram.",

Even though high-level fusion, i.e., impact and threat assessment, is included in the various models, the majority of data fusion research has focused on low-level data fusion such as sensing and correlation. More importantly, low-level fusion technologies have been designed without detailed consideration of threat and impact assessment requirements. On the other hand, high-level designs are restricted by the available data from low-level systems. This disconnected practice has presented tremendous challenges for designing an effective overall fusion system that would truly enhance situation awareness.

Correlating alerts to produce a higher level view of intrusion state of a network, thus, becomes an essential element in network defense. This work proposes to analyze correlated or grouped alerts and determine their 'impact' to services and users of the network. A network is modeled as 'virtual terrain' where cyber attacks maneuver. Overlaying correlated attack tracks on virtual terrain exhibits the vulnerabilities exploited by each track and the relationships between them and different network entities. The proposed impact assessment algorithm utilizes the graph-based virtual terrain model and combines assessments of damages caused by the attacks.

Because of the speed and impacts of new types of cyber attacks, current IDSs are limited in providing accurate detection while reliably adapting to new attacks. In signature-based IDS systems, this limitation is made apparent by the latency from day zero of an attack to the creation of an appropriate signature. This work hypothesizes that this latency can be shortened by creating signatures via anomaly-based algorithms. A hybrid supervised and unsupervised clustering algorithm is proposed for new signature creation. These new signatures created in real-time would take effect immediately, ideally detecting new attacks. This work first investigates a modified density-based clustering algorithm as an IDS, with its strengths and weaknesses identified. A signature creation algorithm\u00a0\u2026",

Due to its complexity, we separate threat projection into two sub-tasks: predicting likely next targets and predicting attacker behavior. A virtual cyber terrain is proposed for identifying likely targets. Overlaying traced alerts onto the cyber terrain reveals exposed vulnerabilities, services, and hosts. Meanwhile, a novel attempt to extract cyber attack behavior is discussed. Leveraging traditional work on prediction and compression, this work identities behavior patterns from traced cyber attack data. The extracted behavior patterns are expected to further refine projections deduced from the cyber terrain.",

While theoretical studies of robot team formation have shown success, it is unclear whether such algorithms will perform well in a real-world environment. This work examines the effect of collision avoidance schemes on an ideal circle formation algorithm, but behaves similarly if robot-to-robot communications are in place. Our findings reveal that robots with basic collision avoidance capabilities are still able to form into a circle, under most conditions. Moreover, the robot sizes, sensing ranges, and other critical physical parameters are examined to determine their effects on algorithm's performance."

The algorithm, TANDI, reduces the problem complexity by separating the models of the attacker's capability and opportunity, and fuse the two to determine the attacker's intent. Unlike traditional Bayesian-based approaches, which require assigning a large number of edge probabilities, the proposed Level-3 fusion procedure uses only 4 parameters.

We start by proposing a maximum data retrieval (MDR) problem that jointly optimizes the routing and scheduling decisions over time for multi-mode wireless sensors. Attempting to solve the general yet extremely complex problem leads to observations and analysis of optimal store-and-forward (S&F) operations for individual sensors in an ideal setting. Our analytical model for the S&F operation provides not only closed form expressions in estimating sensor lifetime and total transmission, but also insights on developing a simpler flow distribution problem that could approximate the MDR problem. Heuristic procedures are then developed to demonstrate the feasibility of having the sensors perform in S&F cycles. Our simulation shows that these heuristics achieves performance close to theoretical estimates derived based on the S&F operation analysis."

We propose that another important metric for a sensor network topology will involve consideration of hidden nodes and asymmetric links. Minimizing the number of hidden nodes and asymmetric links at the expense of increasing the transmit power of a subset of the nodes may in fact increase the longevity of the sensor network.

In order to ease the analysis of the energy usage of proposed network protocols, this paper proposes an energy module, implemented in OPNET, to determine the energy consumption over time during network simulation. Multiple energy consumption modes, such as transmit, idle, sleep modes are all accounted for. A sensor node will be automatically turned off (disabled) in the middle of simulation if it runs out of the user-specified energy. The energy module provides function calls for network protocols implemented in OPNET, and therefore allows performance evaluation in terms of the energy efficiency. Among other protocols, this paper focuses on the topology control schemes, which has individual wireless sensors determine their own transmission power levels while maintaining network connectivity. In order to allow the adjustment of transmission power level having an effect on the transmission range, this paper investigates necessary modifications on the Closure Pipeline stage in OPNET. A simple topology control scheme is implemented for validation purposes. Simulation results will be presented in this paper to exhibit the effect of the closure stage modification as well as the energy modules.",

        "description": "A fundamental, yet usually ignored, challenge to evolving data networks is enabling better Quality of Service (QoS) for best effort traffic. While over-provisioning network resources was considered to be a simple, possibly less expensive solution, the lack of fairly predictable Internet traffic and growth model makes it almost impossible to ensure an \u201cefficiently\u201d dimensioned network. Even if a single carrier could overcome this problem and appropriately provision his network, the heterogeneity of the inter-networking infrastructure would make coordinating inter-carrier agreements to avoid mismatches exceedingly difficult. Recognizing that over-provisioning is at most a partial solution, we approach the problem by \u201cintelligently\u201d share resources that extends the \u201cdynamic range\u201d of traffic loads where networks can ensure adequate system and user perceived performance."

        "description": "During the past few years, multimedia traffic, such as video, audio, and graphics, has gradually shown the potential for becoming the dominant traffic on communication networks. With advanced compression techniques, eg, MPEG [5], multimedia traffic usually has a data rate which varies dramatically over time. In packet switching networks, the network resources, eg, bandwidth and buffer, are typically statistically shared by a number of variable rate connections in order to achieve higher utilization given a fixed QoS constraint. Such sharing of resources is usually called statistical multiplexing. The key to achieve efficient multiplexing is to maximize the number of connections which share the resources. However, on a resource limited network, the QoS constraints on multimedia traffic often limit the number of connections sharing the resources and thus decrease network utilization. This is due to the fact that multimedia traffic usually has big \u201cbursts\u201d which could be in general interpreted as data arrives in high peak rate for a period of time. Thus, limited bandwidth and buffer resources can only accommodate a few connections sending bursts at the same time and therefore statistical multiplexing is less efficient. Similarly a recent proposed technique called Frame Bursting for CSMA/CD on Gigabit Ethernet [14] also has the potential to generate bursty flows by combining and sending multiple frames as a burst. To solve the network utilization problem that are likely to arise in future networks combining multimedia traffic and/or Gigabit Ethernet, we can either further increase the system capacity unlimitedly or take proactive steps to smooth out bursty traffic\u00a0\u2026",

The RBA scheme integrates two previously proposed concepts: bandwidth allocation and reactive arbitration. In, RBA, guaranteed bandwidth is allocated to a connection at call set up based on the traffic characteristics and service requirements, while the arbitration of cell delivery takes into account the queue status to react to traffic fluctuation. Through simulation, we found that by bandwidth allocation, a set of queue threshold levels can be obtained to provide a good approximation to the desired delay performance. Furthermore, around this initial configuration, a linear relationship between the queue threshold and the resulting delay performance can be established to fine-tune the configuration\u00a0\u2026",

This priority arbitrator is targeted to support our new service priority control scheme, reactive bandwidth arbitration (RBA), and new discard priority control scheme, local pushout discarding (LPD). The priority arbitrator is designed for an 8/spl times/8 shared buffer ATM switch with four priority classes per port and a link rate of 622 Mbps.

        "description": "One of the fundamental challenges in developing autonomous cybersecurity agents (AICA) is providing them with appropriate training environments for skills acquisition and evaluation. Current reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms rely on myriads of training runs to instill proper behavior, and this is reasonably achievable only within a simulated environment. In this paper, we explore the topic of simulation models and environments for RL and compile a set of properties and goals necessary to aid the development of AICA with real-world deployability. We also present an assessment framework to compare simulation models designed for simulating cyberattack scenarios. We examine four existing simulation tools, including a new one by the authors of the paper, and discuss their properties, particularly in terms of deployability, to support RL-based AICA. On the example of complex scenarios, we compare in-depth the two most sophisticated simulation tools and discuss their strengths. The paper thus contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a theoretical framework for evaluating RL-focused simulation environments, surveying the currently available environments, and introducing and evaluating a novel and complex simulation environment for next-generation autonomous cybersecurity systems."

In domains such as asymmetric warfare and cyber security, timely and comprehensive impact assessment is critical for human analysts to develop situation awareness and thus make informed decisions. This work investigates critical visual elements that will enhance situation awareness and how to display these elements. Our approach leverages results of threat and impact assessment of ongoing situations. These include changes in effects of activities on assets and mission, and the projection of current situations into the future.

For example, distributed swarmlike behaviors and wireless communication provide opportunities to solve problems such as toxic chemical spills and wildfire containment, hazardous scenarios where human intervention would be risky or even impossible. Coupling wireless networking and simple yet efficient swarm intelligence, a truly decentralized solution has now been developed where robots dynamically form cooperative teams to tackle multiple threats or minimize their impact quickly and efficiently. Figure 1 shows an example of three threats contained by teams of robots.Robot teams have been tried in terrain exploration, 1 target tracking, 2 target pursuit3 and the coordinated movement of objects. 4, 5 More recently, the containment of immobile and mobile threats has drawn attention to the potential of cooperative robotics. For example, Cui and colleagues used robot swarms to localize the emission source of an aerosol threat, but required the robots to work as a single team and to treat only a single source. The group of Stancil considered multiple threats, but the robot actions were coordinated by a central controller processing images transmitted from cameras mounted on each robot. Facing multiple threats in a potentially widespread terrain, each robot in our solution uses its sensors to gather local information, exchange wireless messages, make autonomous decisions to establish or join a threat containment team, and then dissolve the team after the threat is successfully contained."

Due to the simplicity of the tasks performed by these devices, it is not justified to dynamically determine the routes as typical routing protocols do. This paper proposes a lightweight robust forwarding scheme, called Gossip-Based Relay Protocol (GRP) that allows information to be relayed across a wireless ad hoc network. One or more forwarding paths are determined based on probability functions without explicitly maintaining a routing table. With the possibility of \u201cnot\u201d forwarding a message, it also reduces unnecessary flooding and collisions are reduced by adopting a one-time random back-off medium access before transmission without any retries. A simulation model is developed using the OPNET 1Modeler. Performance of GRP is compared against a standard flooding scheme in terms of the message success rate, end-to-end delay, and message flooded in the network. This paper discusses the simulation results as well as the issues associated with topology and network parameters."
