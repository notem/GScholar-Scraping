        "description": "We introduce an Invertible Symbolic Regression (ISR) method. It is a machine learning technique that generates analytical relationships between inputs and outputs of a given dataset via invertible maps (or architectures). The proposed ISR method naturally combines the principles of Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) and Equation Learner (EQL), a neural network-based symbolic architecture for function learning. In particular, we transform the affine coupling blocks of INNs into a symbolic framework, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable symbolic invertible architecture that allows for efficient gradient-based learning. The proposed ISR framework also relies on sparsity promoting regularization, allowing the discovery of concise and interpretable invertible expressions. We show that ISR can serve as a (symbolic) normalizing flow for density estimation tasks. Furthermore, we highlight its practical applicability in solving inverse problems, including a benchmark inverse kinematics problem, and notably, a geoacoustic inversion problem in oceanography aimed at inferring posterior distributions of underlying seabed parameters from acoustic signals."

This chapter reviews these developments with a particular emphasis on recent advancements obtained in the context of event-triggering control. In this framework, a basic realization is that, in the same way that subsequent pauses in spoken language are used to convey information, it is possible to transmit information in CPS not only by message content but also with its timing. Exploiting this possibility, event-triggering control techniques encode information in the timing of the triggering events and can achieve system stabilization at dramatically low data rates."

We develop a framework for the optimal deployment of location-aware networks under bounded disturbances in the positions of the sensing nodes. More specifically, by considering bounded discrepancies in the network geometry, we characterize the optimal deployment according to the D-optimality criterion and assert its implications for the A-optimality and E-optimality criteria.

The goal of the robot is to safely collect observations on the disturbance and construct an accurate estimate of the underlying function. We use Gaussian process to get an estimate of the disturbance from data with a high-confidence bound on the regression error. Furthermore, we use neural contraction metrics to derive a tracking controller and the corresponding high-confidence uncertainty tube around the nominal trajectory planned for the robot, based on the estimate of the disturbance.

We study the trade-offs between the information acquired by the attacker from observations, the detection capabilities of the controller, and the control cost. Specifically, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the expected -deception time, namely the time required by the controller to make a decision regarding the presence of an attacker with confidence at least . We then show a probabilistic lower bound on the time that must be spent by the attacker learning the system, in order for the controller to have a given expected -deception time. We show that this bound is also order optimal, in the sense that if the attacker satisfies it, then there exists a learning algorithm with the given order expected deception time.

While knowledge of the robot's dynamics might be reasonably well known, the heterogeneity of agents in real-world environments means there will always be considerable uncertainty in our prediction of other agents' dynamics.

Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition behavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given event-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing information carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can be stabilized with any positive rate.

The attacker can feed fictitious sensor readings to the controller using its estimate of the plant dynamics and mimicking the legitimate plant operation. The controller, on the other hand, is constantly on the lookout for an attack, and immediately shuts the plant off if an attack is detected. We study the performance of a specific authentication test and, by utilizing tools from information theory and statistics, we bound the asymptotic detection and deception probabilities for any measurable control policy when the\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "We consider the problem of stabilizing an undisturbed, scalar, linear system over a \"timing\" channel, namely a channel where information is communicated through the timestamps of the transmitted symbols. Each symbol transmitted from a sensor to a controller in a closed-loop system is received subject to some to random delay. The sensor can encode messages in the waiting times between successive transmissions and the controller must decode them from the inter-reception times of successive symbols. This set-up is analogous to a telephone system where a transmitter signals a phone call to a receiver through a \"ring\" and, after the random delay required to establish the connection; the receiver is aware of the \"ring\" being received. Since there is no data payload exchange between the sensor and the controller, this set-up provides an abstraction for performing event-triggering control with zero-payload rate. We show the following requirement for stabilization: for the state of the system to converge to zero in probability, the timing capacity of the channel should be, essentially, at least as large as the entropy rate of the system. Conversely, in the case the symbol delays are exponentially distributed, we show an \"almost\" tight sufficient condition using a coding strategy that refines the estimate of the decoded message every time a new symbol is received. Our results generalize previous zero-payload event-triggering control strategies, revealing a fundamental limit in using timing information for stabilization, independent of any transmission strategy.",

We consider an event-triggering strategy that exploits timing information by transmitting in a state-dependent fashion to stabilize a continuous-time, complex, time-invariant, linear system over a digital communication channel with bounded delay and in the presence of bounded system disturbance. For small values of the delay, we show that by exploiting timing information, one can stabilize the system with any positive transmission rate. However, for delay values larger than a critical threshold, the timing information is not enough for stabilization and the sensor needs to increase the transmission rate.

Event triggering carries implicit information, revealing the state of the plant. However, the delay in the communication channel causes information loss, as it makes the state information out of date. There is a critical delay value, when the loss of information due to the communication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by the triggering events. This occurs when the maximum delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant. In this context, extensions of our previous results for event triggering strategies are presented for vector systems and are compared with the data-rate theorem for time-triggered control, that is extended here to a setting with unknown delay.",

For continuous-time scalar systems without disturbances, a phase transition behavior of the transmission rate required for stabilization as a function of the communication delay is revealed. It is shown that for low values of the delay the timing information carried by the triggering events is large and the system can be stabilized with any positive rate. On the other hand, when the delay exceeds a certain threshold that depends on the given triggering strategy, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization and the rate must begin to grow, eventually becoming larger than what required by the classic data-rate theorem.

Through circulant matrix representation we obtain system of non-linear equations that lead to ideal autocorrelation property. Rewriting PN-sequence and its autocorrelation property in {0,1} leads to a definition based on Hamming weight and Hamming distance and hence we can easily prove some results on the PN-sequences with ideal autocorrelation property.",

In systems based on Multicarrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA), this causes losing orthogonality among different spreading codes, leading to poor Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. The performance of such system can be improved by using Generalized Hadamard Codes (GHC) instead of conventional Hadamard codes which avoids the loss of orthogonality. This is due to the fact that unlike conventional Hadamard codes, GHC are conjectured to exist for any arbitrary length. In this paper, we propose using a novel spreading code, namely, GHC for synchronous MC-CDMA in CR networks. The new spreading codes help the CR systems maintaining the data rate while improving the performance by eliminating the orthogonality loss. Finally, the performance of the MCCDMA system\u00a0\u2026"
