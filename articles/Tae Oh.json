This research project uses recent advancements in electrotactile feedback to provide an accurate and timely approach to data visualizations of users who are blind or visually impaired. For this, we developed Electromouse, a mouse-based prototype where users can navigate the screen and feel an electrotactile sensation every time the cursor hits a significant line on the graphic presented on the screen. We performed an early exploration study with five blind adults to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the prototype. Overall, participants were excited for this new method, but had suggestions for improvement related to the form factor, additional graphical information, and multimodal\u00a0\u2026"

On highways, emergency situations associated with vehicles necessitate a reliable media access control (MAC) protocol that can provide timely warnings of possible vehicle collisions. In this paper, we present an edge-assisted cluster-based MAC protocol (ECMAC) for packet dissemination in software-defined vehicular networks. To reduce the control messaging overhead for clustering, ECMAC separates the cluster control plane (i.e., managing cluster formation) from the data plane (i.e., actual data transmission and forwarding) by using a software-defined network controller in a cellular network edge server. For transmitting packets, we design a time-division multiple access (TDMA) schedule algorithm to guarantee a high reliability and a low latency. The TDMA schedule in ECMAC is determined\u00a0\u2026"

However, most of the current research on food delivery services has been focused on the commercial sector and was aimed at the general population. However, there are only limited studies on the user experience and challenges of food delivery services by people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI). To address this gap, this preliminary study conducted an online survey with 166 participants and a semi-structured interview with 12 BVI individuals. The study results revealed the basic usage habits of BVI people experiencing food delivery services and they have been summarized into two major challenges: 1. usability and accessibility of food delivery apps, 2. service design issues. Limitations and various implications for future research on food delivery services are also discussed."

To enhance the accessibility of real-time captioning, we propose Haptic-Captioning which provides real-time vibration feedback on the wrist by directly translating the sound of content into vibrations. We conducted three experiments to examine: (1) the haptic perception (Preliminary Study), (2) the feasibility of the haptic modality along with real-time and non-real-time visual captioning methods (Study 1), and (3) the user experience of using the Haptic-Captioning system in different media contexts (Study 2).

In this paper, we present a context-aware navigation protocol (CNP) that enhances the safety of vehicles driving in urban roads. Firstly, CNP includes a collision avoidance module that builds on both vehicular networks and on-board sensors to track vehicles\u2019 behaviors, and this module analyzes the driving risks to determine the necessary maneuvers in dangerous situations.

        "description": "Cellular networks have become a critical part of business, particularly for machine-to-machine communication. The issue that these wireless 4G nodes are faced with is that 4G cell coverage may not be available so a node cannot be placed in a location or a cell site could go offline, and communication is lost. This paper will cover using Batman-Adv an Ad-Hoc Routing Protocol to dynamically share cellular connections with a pool of hosts that do not have an internet connection. Utilizing Batman-Adv, nodes that have a cellular connection are propagated in the Ad-Hoc Network to all the other nodes. In the event the cellular conditions change or a node in the network goes offline, the Batman-Adv Network will rapidly switch to the next best node with a cellular connection. The result expected is an Ad-Hoc Network sharing multiple cellular connection with its peers and capable of performing rapid routing convergence\u00a0\u2026",

There have been plenty of scenarios and cases that mobile consumers and businesses get into areas that do not have a reliable wireless coverage because of terrain, buildings and distance. Most of us had been a situation where we need Internet access desperately and the cellular network coverage is non-existent. For businesses using machine-to-machine communication, deploying an infrastructure network can be costly or be faced with too many regulatory issues. This can slow down deployment of machine-to-machine devices or stop it all together. When it comes to machine-to-machine communication or IoT devices, CatM was created as an LTE standard to address the needs of low data throughput at a cheap price point. The current implemented version of CatM is inefficient considering\u00a0\u2026"

They are used to inform different parts of the user's hand that an obstacle is detected. 8 people who are blind and 3 people who have low vision explored the IMC's handset by navigating an indoor obstacle path. The participants provided their feedback on the IMC's haptic notification system with regards to the intensity of the vibration and location of the vibrators and discussed various scenarios where the feedback will or will not be useful to them.

However, there is insufficient research performed to develop the guidelines to create a usable smart cane. In this paper, a Dynamic Sensor Orientation Unit (DSOU) is introduced to maintain a detection distance irrespective of the angle of the cane. The paper also aims to outline guidelines for placement of the Obstacle Detection System (ODS) and the sensor angle to be used in our Intelligent Mobility Cane (IMC) prototypes. A usability test with 11 people who use a white cane for daily navigation was conducted to study the users' preference and behavior with a fixed sensor angle IMC. The analysis revealed the angle of the sensor is dependent on the participant's height and how users hold the canes. The results suggest requirements for sensor angle orientation and outline guidelines for ODS designs on future IMCs.",

STMAC exploits a unique spatio-temporal feature characterized from a geometric relation among vehicles to form a line-of-collision graph, which shows the relationship among vehicles that may collide with each other. Based on this graph, we propose a contention-free channel access scheme to exchange safety messages simultaneously by employing directional antenna and transmission power control. Based on an urban road layout, we propose an optimized contention period schedule by considering the arrival rate of vehicles at an intersection in the communication range of a road-side unit to reduce vehicle registration time. Using theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, it is shown that STMAC outperforms legacy MAC\u00a0\u2026",

However, TCP requires the connection initialization using three-way handshaking for the data exchange between two end systems over the Internet. Thus, the efficient operation of TCP is important for data services in the vehicular networks. This paper proposes a method of TCP Context Migration Scheme (TOMS) for the enhancement of data services in vehicular networks. TOMS provides vehicles with proactive TCP connection initialization using a moving TCP proxy as a cluster head, which will have the Internet connectivity with a Road-Side Unit (RSU). A cluster member can initiate its TCP connection toward its corresponding TCP end-system (e.g., server and peer) via the TCP proxy\u00a0\u2026",

The problems related to NNM, or WNNM, can be solved iteratively by applying a closed-form proximal operator, called Singular Value Thresholding (SVT), or Weighted SVT, but they suffer from high computational cost of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) at each iteration. We propose a fast and accurate approximation method for SVT, that we call fast randomized SVT (FRSVT), with which we avoid direct computation of SVD. The key idea is to extract an approximate basis for the range of the matrix from its compressed matrix. Given the basis, we compute partial singular values of the original matrix from the small factored matrix. In addition, by developping a range propagation method, our method further speeds up the extraction of approximate basis at each iteration\u00a0\u2026",

As devices become more ubiquitous and users place more sensitive data on their devices, the amount of mobile malware in the wild has grown. In order to protect mobile device users and their data, mobile security solutions have been brought to market for consumer and enterprise users. The limited success observed in protecting devices so far warrants a redoubled effort to develop effective mobile device security solutions. The research presented in this paper represents the ongoing result of malware analysis for the Android platform by combining code review and behavioral testing. The data collected from these processes suggests the need to implement several security techniques not currently found in Android. To the benefit of users and developers, most of these techniques are coded into Android and provide comprehensive protection\u00a0\u2026",

Collected data may include energy usage, power consumption, local voltage, volt-ampere reactive (VAR) power, and operational status for numerous devices at numerous locations. Device control may include changing taps on transformers, engaging VAR compensation capacitors, disconnecting loads, reducing loads, delaying the start of a load, or changing command set points for distributed generators. All of these tasks require communication of either information or control signals. If invalid, inaccurate, malicious, or untimely information is provided, the effects on the power system operation can be severe, including over-or undervoltage, interruption of power both locally and regionally, damage to connected equipment, hazards to personnel, and financial losses. The information gathered can be used for inappropriate, unexpected, or unsavory purposes by authorized and unauthorized third parties.

By utilizing those capability, CASD provides vehicles with a class-based safety action plan that considers three situations such as the Line-of-Sight unsafe, the Non-Line-of-Sight unsafe and the safe situations. In the Line-of-Sight unsafe situation, a hybrid take-action scheme is provided. If human's action fails, the vehicle will take over the driving control to guarantee the minimum risk. A timing for the vehicle to take over the control is based on an optimized threshold by examining context information. Moreover, a dynamic path maneuver planning scheme is suggested to avoid a crash in real-time. The driving safety can be substantially improved using\u00a0\u2026",

This new protocol operates in the layer 2 of the OSI model. For each Ethernet frame, it encapsulates the EtherType field and the entire IP packet into a new PDU structure that is partially encrypted.

The proposed map contains not only the information on real obstacles nearby but also traffic signs and pedestrians as virtual obstacles.

When attempting to detect malware within a device, it is difficult to draw a clear line between malicious and normal activities. Even useful applications naturally result in data transfer from a mobile device to a remote server and a malware detection mechanism based solely on information flow might consider this as data leakage. Therefore one should also consider the surrounding context of an application to make a better decision on whether it is malicious or not. In this current research, a dynamic analysis approach is taken which monitors and measures the runtime behavior and logs from the mobile application. In particular, a concept of user awareness (UA) is proposed which represents a degree of intent with which an application tries to hide its activities from a user.

This technique utilizes two dependent closed loop amplifiers to enhance the open loop DC gain of the main amplifier. This replicated parallel gain enhancement (RPGE) technique enables a very high DC gain amplifier with an improved harmonic distortion performance. A proof of concept pipeline ADC in a 0.18 um CMOS process using RPGE technique achieves 75 dB SNDR, 91 dB SFDR, -87 dB THD at 20 MS/s. The measured 13 bit DNL and INL is +0.75/-0.36 and +0.88/-0.92 LSB respectively. The ADC operates from a supply voltage of 1.3 V, consumes 5.9 mW\u00a0\u2026",

For the last several years, ASIA has been a great success with excellent papers and participation from academia, industry, and government and well-attended sessions. This year, we again have an excellent set of papers, invited talks, and keynote address. The keynote speaker for ASIA this year is Billy Rios who is currently the Director of Consulting at Cylance, Inc. and the Chair of the Operational Security Testing panel at the National Board of Information Security Examiners (NBISE). He is a fantastic speaker with a wealth of security experience from Microsoft, Google, and Defense Information Systems Agency. We have been able to attract some of the top information systems researchers in the world to the conference.I would like to thank the talented technical program committee that has supported the review process for ASIA. In most cases, the papers were assigned to at least three reviewers who were either members of the program committee or experts outside the committee. It was ensured that there was no conflict of interest. The papers and the reviews were also personally read concurring with reviewer assessment. Our goal is to keep the quality of submissions high as the symposium matures. There were multiple levels of quality control\u2013first with the reviewers, then with the program chair, and then with the general chair. The committee serves a critical role\u00a0\u2026"

As the mobile devices become more pervasive, users increasingly use it more frequently for everything since they are small, portable, and easy to use. Users store all their sensitive data and information on these devices. However, this ease of use comes at a very big price and comes with side-effects which most users are unaware of. With the increase use of mobile devices, malware is also enjoying unprecedented growth at the expense of unsuspecting and na\u00efve users. Even though several mobile security solutions have been proposed, it is apparent that more effort is required to ensure the security of the data on these devices. The research presented in this paper is an attempt to analyze malware behavior by combining code review and live testing to collect and analyze data in an effort to suggest security techniques not currently found in Android-based devices. The results of this research will provide and insight into the targets and actions of malware as well as provide higher security if the techniques are coded into the Android OS.",

In reality, initial deployment stage of vehicular networks would be characterized by limited infrastructure as a result in very limited vehicle to infrastructure communication. However, every vehicle wants the most recent CRLs to protect itself from malicious users and malfunctioning equipments, as well as to increase the overall security of the vehicle networks. To address this challenge, we propose a nomadic device based CRL acquisition method using nomadic device\u2019s communication capability with cellular networks. When a vehicle could not directly communicate with nearby RSUs, the nomadic device acts as a security mediator to perform vehicle\u2019s security functions continuously through cellular networks.

These operating systems are responsible for maintaining a multitude of schedules, messages, calls, music, documents, applications, photos, videos, and other personal data with the goal of increasing efficiency. Because of this, developers of mobile operating systems have built in configuration options to these operating systems to better protect the device from security vulnerabilities. However, not all of these operating systems have such settings turned on when the device is pulled out of the box. Furthermore, not all users are aware of how to best protect their information, nor the kind of issues that should be considered when owning and using these devices.

In this paper we have investigated different types of metadata that are commonly available with the digital objects such as photos and documents that are available in the Internet. We have analyzed different types of metadata information generated by camera and smart phone devices that are used to capture and store digital photos in the web. We have used our analysis to develop heuristics rules which can be used to improve the quality of decision making in forensic investigations. We have also highlighted that such metadata information can be easily used by attackers to further their aims. Finally we have emphasized the need to protect the metadata if they are to provide reliable information for forensic investigations.",

The method uses the merged capacitor switching (MCS) architecture and optimizes the use of the V CM  level during the SAR conversion. This algorithm can reduce switching power by over 12% with no additional DAC driver activity when compared to the MCS scheme. The MCS and EMCS approaches are analyzed mathematically and the EMCS energy consumption is shown to be lower than or equal to that of the MCS technique for every digital code. Static linearity improvements for this structure are also shown with the integral non-linearity (INL) reducing by a factor of two due to the utilization of the MCS three level DAC. The EMCS implementation methodology is also described.",

The auxiliary pipelined TDC is employed to remove the jitter induced error of the main pipelined TDC in the CJS technique. A 12b pipelined TDC adopting the CJS technique in the 1 st  time quantization stage is simulated to validate the proposed technique. Simulation results show that the TDC can achieve a flat SNDR performance of 70dB regardless of the jitter from time reference up to 25% jitter of 1T LSB  in reference clock, which is the maximum error allowed within a designed redundancy range of the pipelined TDC.",

The positive feedback latch is reset to fixed bias voltages of the Class-A output stage during the reset-phase. This dynamic compensation technique for realizing stable amplifier enables power and area savings with improved settling accuracy and THD performance. Simulation results show 30% reduction in overall power consumption, 50% reduction in the size of output stage and 10 dB improvement in settling accuracy compared to conventional Class-A amplifier with similar worst case settling time.",

There is great potential for RFID technology in our society. RFID tags can be used for supply chain management, inventory systems, animal tracking, instant payments or even human implantation. Standards in the RFID industry are examined with an emphasis place on global standardizing bodies. With the growing use of RFID devices in supply chain management and global shipping, several shipping standards including EPC and ASN are examined. Security has become a major concern with several threats to RFID technology recently exposed. Several solutions are presented for firms wishing to implement RFID technology and minimize the risk to sensitive information and company systems.",

This is challenge for distance learning students, who reside long distance from the universities, since they are not able to receive adequate hand-on training and this may cause limited job opportunities after their graduation. Even if universities provide students with distance education those who reside long distance from the universities, students will face difficulties in job opportunities after their graduation.

While developed countries sanctioned by the protocol are committed to achieve their GHG emission targets, developing nations play similar roles on a voluntary basis. Since almost all of the GHGs emissions come from energy sector, it is obvious that energy policy and related regulatory frameworks play imperative roles in realizing the Kyoto Protocol objectives. With carbon dioxide (CO2) touted as the main remedy in the GHGs emissions, it is only reasonable that carbon trading becomes the essential element in the Protocol. Recently a milestone is marked in the Kyoto Protocol with the 2009\u00a0\u2026",

Protocols for link restoration, partial path restoration, and path restoration are evaluated. A new adaptive approach to selecting backup routes is proposed to maximize the probability of successful restoration and minimize restoration time. Using the concept of equivalent bandwidth, an integer linear program is developed that determines a set of backup paths, that meets the QoS constraints, and minimizes the total capacity needed. In computational tests, commercial software successfully solved problem instances of this model in under six seconds on a 600 MHz DEC AlphaStation.",

An important practical issue is the capability to recover quickly from faults. We examine distributed methods for fast fault recovery using modified label distribution protocol messages. To maintain and verify service continuity, methods are proposed for traffic and performance monitoring.",

Immature, polygonal astroblasts contained few glial filaments, in spite of exhibiting positive staining with antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic (GFA) protein. Microtubules were the most prominent cytoskeletal component at early stages of cytodifferentiation, but these were progressively reduced in number at later intervals and were gradually replaced by intermediate filaments. These observations suggest that microtubules are involved in the initial establishment of cytoplasmic asymmetry and process development. Subsequently, glial filaments may play a role in maintaining and stabilizing the overall geometry of the mature astrocyte.",
