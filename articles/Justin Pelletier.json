These attacks have stretched across multiple industries globally and caused billions of dollars of damages. Recent attacks have disrupted critical infrastructure and have served as prelude to war. Studies have shown that there is a lack of awareness among industry practitioners surrounding appropriate responses to ransomware. This failure during a career-defining moment is largely due to the gap between cyber security academic knowledge and industry practice. We therefore provide a learning resource for ransomware response education that is academically adequate, practically viable, and ultimately illustrates a process for proper employment of technology. This case, exposes students to technical requirements for a ransomware response and explores ransomware best practices. Discussion questions and a wargaming-style\u00a0\u2026",

To better understand how an attacker might attempt to compromise an internet facing voting infrastructure, we built and deployed a Virtual Voting Machine (VVM) to masquerade as a real electronic voting machine during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. The honeypot collected 17,682 hits from October 27 to November 9, 2022, even though it was neither publicized nor associated with known elections infrastructure.This paper describes how anyone running such a honeypot might find a huge number of automated hits that are uninteresting, as well as a few that were interesting. We analyzed this traffic and found that many hits resulted from bot-based scraping of our digital architecture or internal security tests.

We analyzed the available literature and found 147 distinct blockchain attacks. We examined these blockchain attack vectors relative to existing blockchain attack taxonomies and found that current taxonomies miss one-third (33.33%) of attack types. We found that blockchain attacks are evolving faster than we can classify them according to conventional taxonomies. To address this, we provide a novel taxonomy of blockchain attacks using a treemap visualization. We believe this taxonomy will help the community understand the context for new attack discoveries and could help researchers better forecast opportunities for future work in blockchain security."

When examining the same using Fuzzy SDT, familiarity with phishing accounted for 6% of the variance in bias. Background in cybersecurity had a statistically significant effect on sensitivity and bias in classical SDT but only on bias in fuzzy SDT. A confusion matrix revealed that the percentage of successfully transmitted information from the stimuli to the judgements made by participants was only 26%.

Some researchers have found that information security incidents have had a decreasing effect on stock price over time. Their reports suggest that breach related stock price impacts have become increasingly shallow and short-lived. This has led some information security economists to suggest that market forces are not enough to incentivize sufficient corporate investment to information security. They argue that further regulation is necessary to remedy what seems like a rise in investor apathy toward corporate breaches. Other researchers, though, have cautioned that further examination is required and that other market metrics\u2014beyond individual stock price movements\u2014are available to better understand the effects of an information security incident.Sector-wide systematic risk is a measure of the sector\u2019s exposure to exogenous shock. Here, this risk measurement is applied to measure the spillover effects of a corporate information security incident. I conduct 203 event studies between the years 2006 and 2016, calculating sector-wide systematic risk within American stock markets, to measure the spillover effects of data breaches within finance, healthcare, technology and services sectors.
