Balanced authentication trees such as the well-known Merkle tree or TEC-Tree can be used to reduce this cost. This work proposes a new method of dynamic authentication trees, which updates a tree structure based on a processor's memory access pattern.

One method by which some of these concerns can be addressed is by introducing hardware obfuscation to the design in various forms. In this work we evaluate the effectiveness of a few different forms of netlist-level hardware obfuscation of a 16-bit substitution box component of a customizable cipher MK-3. These obfuscation methods were attacked using a satisfiability (SAT) attack, which is able to iteratively rule out classes of keys at once.

TreeRecur uses trees to represent the branching recursive function calls of divide-and-conquer algorithms, which makes it possible to take advantage of their procedure-level parallelism. To allow for design flexibility, TreeRecur executes algorithms using a configurable number of independent function processors. These processors are generated using HLS design flow, making it easy to implement a variety of different algorithms.

One of the major steps in this design approach is scheduling, which uses the Control/Data Flow Graph (CDFG) of the software code and determines in which order operations must occur. Traditionally, the scheduling process is time and memory intensive. In this paper, we present a new approach to replace the conventional scheduling portion of the HLS tool chain. This new technique significantly reduces the complexity of scheduling, resulting in improved memory usage and lower computational effort. The results demonstrate that an average 16 times speedup on the time required to determine the schedule can be achieved, with just a fraction (1/5 on average) of the memory usage, and with only 0 to 6% of added cost on the final hardware execution time.",

The power estimations are based on the results obtained from the latest Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.

This time can be greatly reduced however by using tools that can generate hardware systems in the form of a hardware description language (HDL) from high-level languages such as C, C++, or Python. Such implementations can be optimized by applying special directives that focus the high-level synthesis (HLS) effort on particular objectives, such as performance, area, throughput, or power consumption. In this paper we examine the benefits of this approach by comparing the performance and design times of HLS generated systems versus custom systems for matrix multiplication.

This model can be used to quickly explore the design space without any implementation or simulation. We evaluate the model, its usefulness, and ability to identify the bottlenecks and improve performance. Being the core of many compute-intensive applications, linear algebra computations are the main contributors to their total execution time.

Any failure in IMDs operations could cause serious consequences and it is important to protect the IMDs access from unauthenticated access. This study investigates secure IMD data collection within a telehealthcare [mobile health (m-health)] network. We use medical sensors carried by patients to securely access IMD data and perform secure sensor-to-sensor communications between patients to relay the IMD data to a remote doctor\u2019s server. To meet the requirements on low computational complexity, we choose N-th degree truncated polynomial ring (NTRU)-based encryption/decryption to secure IMD\u2013sensor and sensor\u2013sensor communications.

For a long term, ECG data mining is based on pure software implementation, which needs significant calculation time. To speed up the local ECG data processing in a medical sensor, this work proposes the chip design approach to make a dedicate VLSI chip for ECG data pattern recognition.

Typical applications of these functions include data integrity verification and message authentication schemes. We argue that high parallelizability of the forthcoming new SHA-3 hash standard should be a critical and achievable property of proposed algorithms. In this paper we present an FPGA design and performance analysis of a recently proposed parallelizable hash function PHASH. It is not a SHA-3 candidate but rather a hash template using tree hashing and a block cipher. The main feature of PHASH is that it is able to process multiple data blocks at once making it suitable for achieving ultra high performance.

High energy particles can be emitted by cosmic radiation or traces of radioactive elements in device packaging. The result of this could range from unwanted functional or data modification, data loss in the system, to damage to the cell where the charged particle makes impact.

It is very popular especially among Printed Circuit Board (PCB) engineers to verify board level designs. However, PSpice A/D currently lacks the ability to simulate analog components connected to digital circuits that are modeled using Hardware Descriptive Languages (HDLs), such as VHDL and Verilog HDL. Simulation of HDL models in PSpice A/D is necessary to verify mixed signal PCBs where programmable logic devices like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs) are connected to discrete analog components. More than 60% of the PCBs that are designed today contain at least one FPGA or CPLD. This paper investigates the possibility of simulating VHDL models in PSpice A/D. A new design methodology and the necessary tools to achieve this goal are presented. The new design methodology will help engineers verify a complete mixed signal design at the board level. This reduces design failures and hence increases reliability. It also reduces the overall time to market. A mixed signal design from Jackson and Tull for a brushless three phase motor that runs a space application is implemented by following the proposed design methodology.",

Because of SI technique compatibility with the standard digital CMOS technology, it is very convenient to use such filters in image processing. Operation of a system containing 2-D filters in a pre-processing stage is described. Such a system can be implemented in portable one-chip devices like digital video cameras.",

In this paper a modification of such a chip for a digital video camera is presented. The chip contains an image sensing array composed of photodiodes, a two-dimensional DCT processor and an entropy coding section. The processor is designed in a switched-current (SI) technique and contains current mirrors and memory cells. In order to examine these elementary cells, an experimental chip in AMS 0.8 /spl mu/m technology was fabricated.",

        "description": "Modern military communications equipment processes, distributes and stores massive amounts of sensitive or classified data. This equipment is deployed in high risk environments. The communications channels are protected using sophisticated encryption and transmission security technologies, but the internal Data-at-Rest is generally secured using access control, boundary protection and other physical protection mechanisms. If the equipment is captured while in service, a motivated adversary could attempt to breach these mechanisms and compromise the unprotected internal data. This paper presents a key-stream caching methodology and architecture for encrypting/decrypting data in real-time during each memory access. A prototype was developed for the Cyclone III FPGA using a Nios II process and off-chip SRAM to simulate a typical embedded system. Various synthetic applications were used to benchmark the performance overhead of the method. The results show that this can be achieved while incurring as little as 1% performance overhead. This paper presents methodology and design trade-offs of a secure memory controller (SMC) with a keystream cache to allow for an extremely low performance overhead encryption and decryption of a program code and data stored within CPU\u2019s system memory. Our experiments on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) prototype utilizing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher with a 256-bit key and a variety of instruction and data intensive applications show that as little as 1% performance overhead can be achieved."

It is shown how modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices can be used to build a flexible test environment for digital signal processing. Presented implementation gives the advantage of a fast computation and optimum balance between the device speed and logic cost. Moreover the FPGA based reconfigurable realization provides a critical time to market advantage and future feature enhancement capability which make such test system highly valuable for rapid prototyping purposes. As an example a prototype of a nonlinear filter for video restoration is presented. Design statistics and details of a test environment are also discussed."
