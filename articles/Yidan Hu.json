We first created a test bed, which is an MR-based smart factory management system consisting of mid-air gesture-based user interfaces (UIs) on a video see-through MR head-mounted display. To interact with UIs and input information, the user\u2019s hand movements and gestures are tracked by the MR system. We setup the experiment to be the estimation of the password input by users through mid-air hand gestures on a virtual numeric keypad. To achieve this goal, we developed a lightweight machine learning-based hand position tracking and gesture recognition method.

A critical security challenge is to ensure the integrity and completeness of any query result returned by CSPs. As an important type of queries, a location-based skyline query (LBSQ) asks for the POIs not dominated by any other POI with respect to a given query position, i.e., no POI is both closer to the query position and more preferable with respect to a given numeric attribute. While there have been several recent attempts on authenticating outsourced LBSQ, none of them support the shortest path distance that is preferable to the Euclidian distance in metropolitan areas.

To protect user privacy while using LBSs, various Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed that obfuscate users' true locations through random perturbation. However, adversaries can still exploit the temporal correlation between a user's locations in multiple LBS queries to improve inference accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel location inference attack that strikes a good balance between inference accuracy and computational complexity by effectively exploiting temporal correlation. Simulation studies using synthetic and real datasets confirm the advantages of our proposed attack."

A typical indoor navigation system is built on top of a suitable Indoor Positioning System (IPS) and requires the user to periodically submit location queries to learn their whereabouts whereby to provide update-to-date navigation information. Received signal strength (RSS)-based IPSes are considered as one of the most classical IPSes, which locates a user by comparing the user's RSS measurement with the fingerprints collected at different locations in advance. Despite its significant advantages, existing RSS-IPSes suffer from two key challenges, the ambiguity of RSS fingerprints and device diversity, that may greatly reduce its positioning accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the design and evaluation of CITS, a novel RSS-based continuous indoor tracking system that can effectively cope with fingerprint ambiguity and device diversity via differential RSS fingerprint matching. Detailed experiment studies confirm the significant advantages of CITS over prior RSS-based solutions."

This, however, is challenging in large scale 3-D WSNs due to the irregular topology, such as holes in the path, of the network. The irregular topology may cause overestimated Euclidean distance between nodes as the communication path is bent and accordingly introduces severe errors in 3-D WSN localization. As an effort towards the issue, this paper develops a distributed algorithm to achieve accurate 3-D WSN localization. Our proposal is composed of two steps, segmentation and joint localization. In specific, the entire network is first divided into several subnetworks by applying the approximate convex partitioning.

        "description": "This paper presents BlueAer, the first three-dimensional (3D) spatial-temporal fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) monitoring system, which is designed to understand urban PM 2.5  concentration distribution in a fine-grained level. For cost-efficient data collection, vast amount of 3D samples are collected by limited mobile carriers with built-in low-cost sensors. A 3D probabilistic concentration estimated method (3D-PCEM) is proposed to infer PM 2.5  concentration for undetected area, so that the accuracy of BlueAer is ensured. A prototype system of BlueAer has been implemented and worked throughout a year in a 64km 2  testing area with a population of 400,000 in Hangzhou, China. Experimental data has verified that BlueAer can achieve good performance in terms of stability as well as a fine grained 3D distribution of PM 2.5  concentration. The inference accuracy of 3D-PCEM is enhanced by 15.4% and 41.0\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "Arm motion recognition and its related applications have become a promising human computer interaction modal due to the rapid integration of numerical sensors in modern mobile\u2010phones. We implement a mobile\u2010phone\u2010based arm motion recognition and exercise coaching system that can help people carrying mobile\u2010phones to do body exercising anywhere at any time, especially for the persons that have very limited spare time and are constantly traveling across cities. We first design improved k-means algorithm to cluster the collecting 3\u2010axis acceleration and gyroscope data of person actions into basic motions. A learning method based on Hidden Markov Model is then designed to classify and recognize continuous arm motions of both learners and coaches, which also measures the action similarities between the persons. We implement the system on MIUI 2S mobile\u2010phone and evaluate the system\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "This paper develops a mobile sensing system, the first system used in adaptive resolution urban air quality monitoring. In this system, we employ several taxis as sensor carries to collect original PM2.5 data and collect a variety of datasets, including meteorological data, traffic status data, and geographical data in the city. This paper also presents a novel method AG\u2010PCEM (Adaptive Grid\u2010Probabilistic Concentration Estimation Method) to infer the PM2.5 concentration for undetected grids using dynamic adaptive grids. We gradually collect the measurements throughout a year using a prototype system in Xiasha District of Hangzhou City, China. Experimental data has verified that the proposed system can achieve good performance in terms of computational cost and accuracy. The computational cost of AG\u2010PCEM is reduced by about 40.2% compared with a static grid method PCEM under the condition of reaching\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "The frequent hazy weather has brought enormous threaten to human health, especially in developing countries. Modeling a fine-grained distribution of PM 2.5 (Particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 \u03bc m) concentrations is of great importance for industrial and environmental applications. The contradiction between the need of fine-grained distribution and the approach of coarse-grained collection has to be addressed immediately. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of inferring PM 2.5 concentration of unobserved areas based on data samples collected by mobile sensors. We propose a Probabilistic Concentration Estimation Method (PCEM) for a regional fine-grained PM 2.5 distribution considering the nature of particle motion. It simulates particles transport in an open air-flow field referring the concept of random walk. In the meantime, quadratic programming and heuristic function are also\u00a0\u2026",
