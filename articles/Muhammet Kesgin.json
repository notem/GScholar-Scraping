The structural model was tested using PLS-SEM with the data collected via a self-administrated survey between April and June 2021 in Saudi Arabia (N\u2009=\u2009759).

First, we find that attractions have varying makeup of SC as represented in the six dimensions of SC. Second, repeat visits increase SC. Third, SC positively impacts revisit intentions even in the absence of prior experience. We also find that prior experience does not appear to yield better ratings, however, it predicts revisit intentions. This study represents the first use of SC in the tourism domain.

        "description": "Tourism is becoming a common issue of contemporary life and the concept of tourist behaviour is central to the entire discipline of tourism (Cohen, 2004). Although much is known about the multiplicity of tourists\u2019 motivations and the growing divergence of tourists\u2019 behaviour/experiences at the destination, tourists are continually treated as a homogeneous group (Wang, 2000). The convergence\u2013divergence debates can be effective in explaining why tourists are treated as a homogeneous group by some analysts and heterogeneous by others. Both convergent and divergent lenses have advantages and disadvantages. Based on market divergence, segmentation approaches recognize tourist disaggregation, rather than uniform treatments of tourists, contradicting segmentation. However, individual treatment of tourists is also impractical. A pluralist framework is needed for successful destination marketing through the identification of meaningful segments that capture common preferences and expectations among tourists, but is met with complications (Wickens, 2002). Like tourists, destinations are also treated as uniform. For example, Alanya, Turkey, is often promoted as an identikit destination that calls for fun in the sun. However, in addition to its typical Mediterranean characteristics, Alanya is a naturally beautiful tourist destination with much to offer. Tourist areas such as Alanya can benefit from destination-based studies in designing and implementing their destination marketing. An understanding of the determinants of holiday choice, therefore, has important implications for destination managers. Within this overall framework, this chapter\u00a0\u2026"

        "description": "This chapter provides the results of an empirical study conducted to investigate the profile, motivations and experiences of tourists visiting Alanya Castle in Alanya, Turkey. The study sought to identify the significance and nature of cultural motivations and experiences in the context of the so-called mass tourist market and to obtain insights into dimensions of curiosity. The study utilized the ATLAS Cultural Tourism Research Project standard questionnaire with some additional questions, and employed a convenience sample of 385 respondents. The results showed that coastal pleasures were of primary importance and central to respondents\u2019 motivations and experiences. Cultural attractions and cultural tourism experiences were also of interest to respondents. Perceptual curiosity was more important than epistemic curiosity for visiting the resort area and the cultural attraction. The study suggests several courses of action for managing and marketing destinations in general and tourist attractions in particular."

Employing a convenience sample of 505 holidaymakers visiting a coastal holiday resort in the Mediterranean, the thesis provides a destination-based analysis of the tourist experience process in three analytical phases. Utilising qualitative and quantitative techniques, the study investigates and addresses, in particular, two specific issues: Motivators, constraints and facilitators of holiday choice; and evaluation of holiday/destination behaviour and experiences. The underlying characteristic of Alanya holiday was found to be seeking 'fun in the sun'. \u2017Being away\u2018 was more important than \u2017being there\u2018 as long as sunny weather and the 'right price\u2018 were guaranteed. Coastal pleasures dominated the holiday activity, and social and cultural contacts were also significant. Motivations, constraints and facilitators were significant determinants of holiday choice and holiday activity patterns. Supporting consumption experiences were the facilitators of peak experiences. Both peak and supporting consumption experiences were crucial in combination for holidaymakers\u2018 satisfaction. Preferences and perceptions indicated both similarities and differences between holidaymakers. Differences that are rather more significant were based on repeat visitation patterns. Socio-demographic characteristics were more significant for pre-and on-site experience phases. Trip characteristics were more significant\u00a0\u2026",

Scholars have commonly adopted the term \u2018dark tourism\u2019, first coined  by Foley and Lennon (1996) (see for example, Cohen 2010; Mowatt and Chancellor 2011). Nevertheless, the common usage of this term does not suggest the  existence of an accepted definition of this social phenomenon. Moreover, there  is a general agreement that dark tourism still remains \u2018theoretically fragile\u2019  (Stone and Sharpley 2008: 575) and \u2018poorly conceptualized\u2019 (Jamal and Lelo  2011: 31). In line with Seaton and Lennon\u2019s (2004) observation that there are  more questions than answers in relation to\u00a0\u2026",

Attractions of these destinations motivate visitors to travel but are not enough alone because visitors also take into account high service quality delivered for adequate satisfaction. Therefore, service quality and its perceptions in cultural/heritage places have primary importance and they need investigation. This study attempts to determine the perceptions and satisfactions of visitors to Alanya Castle which is considered as an open-airmuseum. The study was conducted in the Alanya Castle in Antalya with a total of 410 respondents. In order to analyse the data gathered in the survey, a scale was used by adapting similiar studies such as HISTOQUAL and\u00a0\u2026",

With the recognition of the importance of these impacts on host perceptions and attitudes, numerous studies have been conducted towards tourism development. However, resident\u2019s perceptions studies of tourism development are superfluous; there are a few empirical studies on local authorities\u2019 and non-governmental organizations\u2019(NGOs) perceptions of tourism development. In this regard, this study aims to determine the local authorities\u2019 and NGOs\u2019 perceptions of tourism development and urbanization in Alanya with an empirical study. The major findings have shown that both local authorities and NGOs strongly agree that tourism certainly improves the quality of life in the region, the establishment of an integrated management approach is essential and that the tourism development should be promoted in qualitative perspective. The findings indicated that the planning of further tourism development and urbanization should be encouraged within the aim to offer a higher quality of life for hosts and guests.",

Thus, the success of the destination in world markets is affected by its relative competition power (Enright and Newton 2004: 777). Many markets are saturated leading to increasing competition between brands (Raaij, Strazzieri and Woodside 2001: 59). As a result of this, the competition dimension between destination brands decreased to local level (Taskin and Giiven 2003: 55). Now, there is a need to \u201cdevelop a marketing communication strategy\u201d for each destination brand in such a way that provides standing out with its own unique difference.

Working in the hospitality industry, entry-level employees usually suffer from a heavy workload, long working hours, and low pay. The frontline employees, such as hotel receptionists and restaurant servers, are required to have a higher level of emotional intelligence to present friendliness and empathy to the guests. The employees at the management level have high work stress of sustaining the business success in financial and non-financial aspects in the fierce market competition. Therefore, the high job turnover rate is one of the well-known features of the hospitality industry."
