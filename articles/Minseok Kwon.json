The server-to-server wireless datacenter network (S2S-WiDCN) requires Line-of-Sight (LoS) between servers to establish direct communication links. Utilizing this LoS links, a horizontal-first routing algorithm is developed which, will establish fast communication links between any pair of communicating servers in the data center. The wireless links can be realized in millimeter-wave (such as 30, 60, 120 GHz) or THz (such as 300 GHz) frequency bands. The use of antenna-arrays to create beam-steering towards communicating servers is necessary to establish the direct server-to-server links. In the presence of an obstruction such as an IT technician, the LoS between communicating servers may be blocked. To address this issue, an\u00a0\u2026",

The state-of-the-art prediction models, e.g., Ernest and Cherrypick, treat DL workloads as black boxes, and require running the given DL job on a fraction of the dataset. Moreover, they require retraining their prediction models every time a change occurs in the given DL workload. This significantly limits the reusability of prediction models across DL workloads with different deep neural network (DNN) architectures. In this paper, we address this challenge and propose a novel approach where the prediction model is trained only once for a particular dataset type, e.g., ImageNet, thus completely avoiding tedious and costly retraining tasks for predicting the training time of new DL workloads\u00a0\u2026"

This raises the question: Can network administrators build their own DPI-capable filter using a standard programmable switch? The common answer is that standard switches support P4, which allows users to specify how to parse packet headers, but not packet payload fields (e.g. URL) thus DPI tasks, like URL filtering, require dedicated middleboxes. In this paper, we challenge this common answer. First, we demonstrate that clients send packets with a predictable structure, so a P4 switch can perform some DPI (enough for URL filtering). Second, we demonstrate a URL-filtering firewall completely in the data plane, with no external help from the SDN controller, firewalls, etc. and no custom logic. Our proof-of-concept, P4Wall, handles multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) with high performance\u00a0\u2026"

However, owing to the limitations of packet parsing in P4, these tasks involve only the packet headers. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) \u2013 i.e., inspection of the packet payload \u2013 in the data plane, using P4 alone. We make use of the fact that in P4, a switch can clone and recirculate packets. One copy (clone) can be recirculated, slicing off a byte in each round, and using a finite-state machine to check if a target string has yet been seen. If the target string is found, the other copy (original packet) is discarded; if not, it is passed through. Our approach allows us to\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "Servers in a data center are underutilized due to overprovisioning which contributes heavily toward the high-power consumption of the data centers. Server consolidation can drastically reduce the power consumption of data centers by engaging fewer servers and keeping the unused servers in deep sleep. However, server consolidation alone can adversely affect network performance. Recently, wireless data centers using high-speed millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have been proposed and shown to drastically reduce the power consumption of the networking equipment. Therefore, server-consolidation strategies should leverage the novel data center network architectures to minimize power consumption with minimal impact on performance. Neither novel server consolidation algorithms for wireless data centers nor the impact of server consolidation on wireless data centers have been explored so far\u00a0\u2026",

Counting Bloom filters address this drawback using counters at the expense of increased filter size. Other alternatives like the Deletable Bloom Filter (DlBF) or the Ternary Bloom Filter (TBF) have been proposed to maintain a small filter size while supporting deletions of elements with some probability. These structures offer different trade-offs between deletability, false positive rate and filter size. In this paper, we propose a new filter called the D-FP (Deletable Fingerprint) Bloom filter that stores two-bit fingerprints, instead of a single bit or a counter, that can indicate whether the item can be deleted. By using the fingerprints, the D-FP Bloom filter provides lower false positive rates than the TBF at low filter occupancies and better deletability than the DlBF thus providing more options to desginers that want to trade-off both parameters.

We note that an expert network administrator can develop a \u201cgut feeling\u201d that lets them identify mistaken or attack updates. Might it be possible to capture such intuition in a learning-based anomaly detection mechanism? Our idea is that good route updates share characteristics which bad updates do not, and even if such characteristics are subtle (i.e. cannot be captured in clear rules), they can be learned. More specifically, an auto-encoder (trained on known-good BGP routing data) will successfully encode good route updates, but will perform more poorly with random or malicious updates. In our system, we use two auto-encoders, each trained to detect a specific type of anomalous BGP update. If either auto-encoder performs poorly (i.e. shows large differences between input and output), we report the BGP update as likely-anomalous\u00a0\u2026",

Yet only a small portion of FIB entries carries the most of the network traffic. Thus, FIB caching, namely, installing the most popular entries in a fast memory, e.g., TCAM, may significantly minimize TCAM usage. In this work, we leverage the concept of the programmable data plane to design a Programmable FIB Caching Architecture (PFCA) with two levels of cache. We present a pipeline-based algorithm to detect the least popular prefixes in a cache for victim eviction.

        "description": "A Bloom filter is a succinct data structure for membership queries. While the filter enables a compact storage, it allows false positives when queried and exhibits an inherent tradeoff between the false positive rate and space complexity. Among many applications, IP address lookup shows promise for improvement using on-chip Bloom filters; however, high false positive rates may cause more off-chip memory access and degrade the performance significantly. We introduce a new Bloom filter called the length-aware Bloom filter (LABF) for multiple pattern matching problems. The primary idea is to explore the discrepancy in length distribution between the set of patterns and the set of prefixes of input text that are examined against the patterns. While maintaining the simplicity, LABFs outperform the standard Bloom filter when the pattern lengths are nonuniformly distributed in a wide range. Such pattern length\u00a0\u2026",

One of the major challenges in these datacenters is load balancing and shifting. As a huge number of requests are sent to a particular datacenter or a group of servers are asked to process more than their fair share, some of the servers are overloaded, slowed down, hot spots are created, and even hardware failures may occur. This unbalanced load in the end deteriorates the performance of the entire system easily. In this paper, we propose a load balancer that aims at alleviating hot spots and distributing the load from overloaded servers to underutilized servers. Our load balancer monitors the loads of the servers, detects indications of overloading, then migrates virtual instances from overloaded servers to target servers. We\u00a0\u2026",

While nodes join and leave dynamically, one of the hard challenges posed by DHTs is load balancing across the ID space. Tries are known to be a viable data structure such that a balanced trie implies balanced intervals in the ID space. We establish a distributed trie as a deployable overlay network that connects the IDs of participating nodes. We propose a decentralized, efficient, and low-cost algorithm that balances ID intervals in DHTs using the trie. Our scheme allows a node to join or leave the system at a low cost, R + \u0398(log log n), where R denotes the message routing cost in DHTs and n is the number of nodes. Compared to the prior ID assignment schemes that require R + \u0398(log n) at best for the same operations, our new algorithm\u00a0\u2026",

Once an anomaly is detected, video sensors start video capturing the anomaly and transmit burst of real time streaming data over the network.

To address these security concerns, we propose an extension to Chord named Sechord. The main idea is that the source can determine whether the next hop is valid or invalid by estimating how far the next hop is from its finger pointer. If the next hop is too far away from the finger pointer, especially compared to the average distance between two consecutive peers, the source can infer some ongoing malicious activities.

Our approach monitors real-time data streams (e.g., RTP), and inserts packets containing fraudulent voice data at expected times estimated from the monitoring. As false packets are well-aligned with original packets, we can maximize the effects of the test while minimizing the number of inserted packets.

De facto network security solutions (e.g., trusted servers, encryption, and firewalls) offer little assistance, as they are often not compatible with the open and decentralized structure of peer-to-peer networks. To address overlay security problems, we propose Phyllo, a node-partitioning framework that isolates untrusted nodes from the core network. Yet, the isolated nodes can still participate in peer-to-peer communications. Our partitioning scheme also allows nodes to move between partitions, while introducing marginal performance overheads.

Overlay networks offer several attractive features, including ease of deployment, flexibility, adaptivity, and an infrastructure for collaboration among hosts. In this paper, we explore cooperation among co-existing, possibly heterogeneous, overlay networks. We design Synergy, a utility-based overlay internetworking architecture that fosters overlay cooperation. Our architecture promotes fair peering relationships to achieve synergism. Results from Internet experiments with cooperative forwarding overlays indicate that our Synergy prototype improves delay, throughput, and loss performance, while maintaining the autonomy and heterogeneity of individual overlay networks.",

Overlay networks have emerged as a new strategy to suggest ways of introducing disruptive technology under these circumstances. Overlays can be used as a vehicle to implement new functionalities between the core IP networks and end-user computers, without the support from the ISPs. Several types of overlay networks for resilient routing, multicasting, quality of service, content distribution, storage, and object location have recently been proposed."

Overlay solutions have been introduced for multicasting, inter-domain routing, content distribution, content storage, quality of service, and peer-to-peer networking problems. Since overlays are easy to deploy, several diverse overlay networks may simultaneously exist in the Internet. These overlay networks may compete for the same resources on shared hosts and underlying network links and routers. The overlays may also have heterogeneous performance and service goals, such as minimum latency versus maximum bandwidth, and multicast distribution versus unicast forwarding. The possibility of cooperation among overlay networks to enhance their collective performance thus emerges. This cooperation may not only improve performance, but also enable sharing\u00a0\u2026",

While analytical and experimental studies have debated whether dropping/marking should be based on average or instantaneous queue length or, alternatively, based on input and output rates (or queue length slope), the merits and drawbacks of the proposed algorithms, and the effect of load-based versus queue-based control have not been adequately examined. In particular, only RED has been tested in realistic configurations and in terms of user metrics, such as response times and average delays. In this paper, we examine active queue management (AQM) that uses both load and queuing delay to determine its packet drop/mark probabilities.  This class of algorithms, which we call load/delay controllers (LDC), has the advantage of controlling the queuing delay as well as\u00a0\u2026",

We study the properties of TAG, and model and experiment with its economies of scale factor to quantify its benefits compared to unicast and IP multicast. We also compare the TAG approach with the ESM approach in a variety of simulation configurations including a number of real Internet topologies and generated topologies.

The new idea is to embed a watermark in dynamic data structures, thereby protecting against many program-transformation attacks. Until now there have been no reports on practical experience with this technique. We have implemented and experimented with a watermarking system for Java based on the ideas of Collberg and Thomborsen. Our experiments show that watermarking can be done efficiently with moderate increases in code size, execution times and heap-space usage, while making the watermarked code resilient to a variety of program-transformation attacks. For a particular representation of watermarks, the time to retrieve a watermark is on the order of one minute per megabyte of heap space. Our implementation is not designed\u00a0\u2026",

A query from a peer is relayed to next peers until the query reaches the peer that contains correct data. Searching in peer-to-peer networks is a challenge for the following reasons: 1) huge data size, 2) complex management required, 3) dynamic network conditions, and 4) distributed systems. Moreover, a blind and uninformed search may lead to performance degradation due to its redundancy and resource wastes. To address these weaknesses, Distributed Hash Table (DHT) has been proposed to place tight constraints on node placement. DHT-based approaches, however, does not consider content relations (or locality).We propose a new peer-to-peer model that utilizes locality in the network to mitigate the complexity in data searching.
