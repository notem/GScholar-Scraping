These attacks have stretched across multiple industries globally and caused billions of dollars of damages. Recent attacks have disrupted critical infrastructure and have served as prelude to war. Studies have shown that there is a lack of awareness among industry practitioners surrounding appropriate responses to ransomware. This failure during a career-defining moment is largely due to the gap between cyber security academic knowledge and industry practice. We therefore provide a learning resource for ransomware response education that is academically adequate, practically viable, and ultimately illustrates a process for proper employment of technology.

However, this creates a new attack surface where receivers cannot determine whether the causes of signature verification failures are indeed malicious attacks.

Our novel, targeted attack is highly efficient (even given the short validity period for vehicle pseudonyms) and difficult to detect.

Specifically, this paper describes knowledge-seeking activities carried out through designing and implementing a workshop program that brought together twenty-four faculty with experience in partnered teaching of CS+X courses. The goal is to take the initial steps towards preparing and supporting CS faculty to create interdisciplinary CS+X courses through partnerships with faculty in other disciplines, in order to spur interdisciplinary thinking in students.",

Distributed anonymization methods can reduce the dependency on service providers, thus promising more privacy for the consumers. However, the distributed communication among the end-users introduces overhead and requires methods to prevent external attacks. In this paper, we propose four variants of a distributed anonymization method for smart metering data privacy, referred to as the Collaborative Anonymity Set Formation (CASF) method.

Smartphones are subject to traditional computer network covert channel techniques. Smartphones also introduce new sets of covert channel techniques as they add more capabilities and multiple network connections. This work presents a new network covert channel in smartphones. The research studies the ability to leak information from the smartphones applications by reaching the cellular voice stream, and it examines the ability to employ the cellular voice channel to be a potential medium of information leakage through carrying modulated speech-like data covertly. To validate the theory, an Android software audio modem has been developed and it was able to leak data successfully through the cellular voice channel stream by carrying modulated data with a throughput of 13 bps with 0.018% BER. Moreover, Android security policies are investigated and broken in order to implement a user-mode rootkit that opens the voice channels by stealthily answering an incoming voice call. Multiple scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed covert channel. This study identifies a new potential smartphone covert channel, and discusses some security vulnerabilities in Android OS that allow the use of this channel demonstrating the need to set countermeasures against this kind of breach.",

To address these issues and build the needed expertise, this paper proposes a flexible training framework for integrating CIP into cybersecurity training. The foundation of this framework is a set of self-contained training modules; each module is a distinct unit for use by an instructor. Modules are meant to be integrated at different levels, with subsequent modules building on those presented earlier.

Tracking of web clients has been difficult since HTTP is a stateless protocol. Existing methods are limited to the current session and are not designed to track a client long-term or through different environments. This paper evaluates and rates the most popular methods of tracking web users in terms of the uniqueness of the information provided by them, and how well they preserve information when a client attempts to remove them. The tracking methods are then combined using a profiling algorithm to correlate all of the available information into a single profile. The algorithm is designed with different weights for each method. Test results demonstrate that this approach accurately determines the correct profile for a client in situations where the individual\u00a0\u2026",

However, such healthcare information sharing requires to be done securely with privacy guarantees, as required by law. Among its other requirements, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires the use of appropriate access control mechanisms to protect healthcare information. Despite these legal requirements, currently implemented access control models in the healthcare domain are typically inadequate as demonstrated by the large and increasing numbers of successful attacks on healthcare systems. In particular, current access control models do not provide sufficient protection for healthcare systems from attacks by insiders, ie, authorized healthcare personnel. This paper examines how healthcare information can be protected from unauthorized or improper use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction by healthcare providers. Using a holistic approach toward modeling access control, the authors construct a threat model for access control in healthcare systems. The constructed model is then used to assess the effectiveness of current access control mechanisms such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), as well as the BiLayer Access Control (BLAC) model, which was proposed as a flexible, higher-performance replacement for both RBAC and ABAC.",

In this work, we focus on jamming type DoS attacks at the physical and MAC layers in 802.11 based ad hoc networks. Collisions in wireless networks occur due to varying factors such as jamming attacks, hidden terminal interferences and network congestion. We present a probabilistic analysis to show that collision occurrence alone cannot be used to conclusively determine jamming attacks in wireless channel. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel collisions. To address this, we first investigate the problem of diagnosing the presence of jamming in ad hoc networks. We then evaluate the detection mechanism using cross-layer information obtained from physical and link layers to differentiate between jamming and congested network scenarios. By correlating the cross-layer data with collision detection metrics, we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior. Through simulation results we demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in detecting jamming with improved precision.",

Since communications is done at relatively high frequencies, as compared with frequencies emitted by underwater vehicles, these higher frequencies are attenuated more rapidly by the medium. Therefore, at a minimum, sensors must be deployed within communications range of each other. Unfortunately, human or mechanical error and physical aspects of the medium may lead to sensors being deployed imprecisely, causing a lack of connectivity between sensors. To mitigate such situations, this paper proposes a stochastic approach, the Effective Communications Range Calculator, for determining an effective communications range with which to design underwater sensor fields to meet the connectivity specifications of the field designer.",

It is unlikely that a large water space will have uniform acoustic characteristics throughout, i.e., the performance of a sensor will vary based upon its physical location. In an area clearance scenario, where there is no apparent target for an adversary to gravitate towards, such as a ship or a port, it is difficult to determine where the field designer should allocate sensors so that their deployment locations can be planned efficiently. To intelligently allocate sensors, a field designer could first divide an area into sectors of relatively uniform acoustics, based upon variations in acoustic characteristics throughout the area.

The PRNG is developed by superimposing a certain number or periodic waves such that the same pseudo random number is generated at two different devices that share a secret key. The generated pseudo random numbers are used for securing messages between the two devices. It is shown that this PRNG is capable of self synchronization, secure against most attacks and can be implemented both in hardware and software. In addition, the solution is lightweight and is ideal for wireless communication where the devices may be resource constrained. Analysis and extensive testing using the DIEHARD tests indicate that the developed PRNG exhibits high statistical randomness. The generated pseudo random numbers are also cryptographically secure and are thus suitable for\u00a0\u2026",

The space-based network technology considers the ground stations and the spacecrafts to be a part of one large network, where a spacecraft can potentially connect to a large number of ground stations during its orbit. However, the technology introduces easy access to the spacecraft from the ground, in turn increasing the security risks. Additionally, space-based networks are formed among heterogeneous network entities. Thus, a generic security solution for all communication components may not be well suited. In this work, we study the architecture of space-based networks, and provide a classification for the network entities based on their characteristics. Based on the requirements and limitations of the classification, we provide suitable key management solution for enhanced security and strong authentication.",

The nodes are grouped into clusters, and keys are distributed such that intra-cluster communication is secured using a symmetric cryptosystem and inter-cluster communication is secured using an asymmetric cryptosystem. We present a detailed analysis of the solution and simulation results.

A recent approach to dynamic load balancing is the integrated cellular and ad hoc relay (iCAR) system (see Wu, H. et al., 2001; De, S. et al., 2002; Qiao, C. et al., 2000). iCAR employs ad hoc relay stations (ARS) in the cellular network to balance traffic loads efficiently and to share channels between cells via primary and secondary relaying. We provide a general framework for dynamic load balancing in iCAR systems, where the number of hot cells, the location of these hot cells and the traffic distribution in the system is arbitrary.

Currently, all the cells of a location area (LA) are paged at the same time to locate the mobile user (MU). Efforts have been made to reduce the overhead paging bandwidth cost by using multi-step paging methods. However, in the case of multi-step paging schemes, such as sequential paging and intelligent paging, additional paging delay is introduced. It is shown that if the paging cost computation is based on the number of paged cells only, then, in certain cases, one may obtain misleading results. To resolve this dilemma, a new cost function, in terms of the number of cells paged and the paging delay, is introduced. Thus, this new metric provides a powerful tool that can be used to analyze all multi-step paging procedures with constrained or unconstrained delay.",

Also, two kinds of algorithms for grouping the paging areas (PAs) are considered.

Due to the smaller cell size in PCS, the high boundary crossing rate of PS will result in more frequent location area (LA) updating. This, in turn, will result in more interrogations with location registers, which will generate a higher volume of access and signaling traffic (SS7 traffic).

Such sharing must be done securely and meet the privacy guarantees imposed by applicable laws and regulations; for instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States requires the use of appropriate access control mechanisms to protect healthcare information. Despite such legal requirements, currently implemented access control models in e-Health systems are often inadequate as demonstrated by the large and increasing numbers of successful attacks on healthcare systems. In particular, current access control models do not provide sufficient protection for healthcare systems from attacks by insiders, ie, authorized personnel. This paper examines insider threats and presents an approach to protect healthcare information from unauthorized or improper use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction by healthcare personnel. Using a holistic approach toward modeling access control, a threat model for access control in healthcare systems is first designed and constructed, and then used to assess the effectiveness of common access control models that are used in or have been proposed for healthcare systems including Role-Based Access Control and Attribute-Based Access Control, as well as a new access control model, BiLayer Access Control, which was proposed to provide the advantages of both Role-Based and Attribute-Based models without their disadvantages.",
