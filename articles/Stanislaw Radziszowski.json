In this paper we present our experience developing and launching a course in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). PQC refers to cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers. Such systems may be achieved through classical (ie non-quantum) means. Because of progress in the design of quantum computers and the ongoing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) process to develop post-quantum cryptographic systems, we realized that there is a need to design a course that covers the consequences of developments in quantum computing (QC), the threats of QC to currently used cryptographic schemes, and how to mitigate those threats by developing quantum-resistant schemes. We designed a new course that is attracting students interested in the future of cryptography and computing security/cybersecurity. We first offered it as an MS-level graduate course, also open to upper-level undergraduates, in Spring 2022, and followed with the second offering in Spring 2023. The course covers the PQC algorithm design process, the consequences of QC, some computationally hard problems and then discusses selected proposals for post-quantum cryptosystems designed to be resistant to known classical and quantum attacks. Three main types of such designs include lattice-based,"

Defense against bus attacks such as spoofing, splicing, and replay attacks is of particular concern. Traditional memory authentication techniques, such as hashes and message authentication codes, require significant amounts of on-chip memory and introduce a large performance impact when protecting off-chip memory during run-time. Balanced authentication trees such as the well-known Merkle tree or TEC-Tree can be used to reduce this cost. This work proposes a new method of dynamic authentication trees, which updates a tree structure based on a processor's memory access pattern. An HDL model for use in an FPGA has been developed as a transparent and highly customizable AXI-4 memory controller. The performance of our tree design is comparable to that of\u00a0\u2026"

The benefits and applications of HE are far reaching, especially in regard to cloud computing. However, current HE solutions require a large number of resource intensive arithmetic operations such as high precision, high degree polynomial multiplication. This work aims to accelerate the multi-precision arithmetic operations used in HE with specific focus on an implementation of the Sch\u00f6nhage-Strassen Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based multiplication algorithm. It is planned to be incorporated into a larger HE library of arithmetic functions tuned for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) that enables flexible solutions for hardware/software systems on reconfigurable cloud resources. The developed FFT based polynomial multiplier exhibits flexibility in the selection of HE\u00a0\u2026",

A CDS that is able to function in the presence of untrusted parties is a challenge. We apply the concepts of homomorphic encryption (HE) to explore a new solution to the CDS problem.

While originated in mathematical logic, it has applications in geometry, number theory, game theory, information theory, approximation algorithms, and other areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. Ramsey theory studies the conditions of when a combinatorial object necessarily contains some smaller given objects. The central concept in Ramsey theory is that of arrowing, which in the case of graphs describes when colorings of larger graphs necessarily contain monochromatic copies of given smaller graphs. The role of Ramsey numbers is to quantify some of the general existential theorems in Ramsey theory, always involving arrowing. The determination of whether this arrowing holds is notoriously difficult, and thus it leads to numerous computational challenges concerning various types of Ramsey numbers and closely related Folkman numbers. This talk will overview how computers are increasingly used to study the bounds on Ramsey and Folkman numbers, and properties of Ramsey arrowing in general. This is happening in the area where traditional approaches typically call for classical computer-free proofs. It is evident that now we understand Ramsey theory much better than a few decades ago, increasingly due to computations. Further, more such progress and new insights based on computations should be anticipated."

MK-3 is one such algorithm, developed through a joint effort between Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and Harris Corporation. It uses the duplex construction, which builds on the sponge primitive popularized by Keccak, the SHA-3 competition winner. MK-3 is intended for hardware implementations with a novelty being the use of 16-bit substitution boxes. This paper presents the first fully parallel hardware implementation of MK-3 using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We also lay the groundwork for future design optimizations.",

It can be expressed as follows: Given an integer k and a connected n-vertex tripartite cubic graph Q=(V, E) with independence number \u03b1 (Q), does Q contain an independent set I of size k such that Q\u2212 I is bipartite? We are interested for which values of k the answer to this question is affirmative. We prove constructively that if \u03b1 (Q)\u2265 2 n/5, then the answer is positive for each k satisfying\u230a(n\u2212 \u03b1 (Q))/2\u230b\u2264 k\u2264 \u03b1 (Q). It remains an open question if a similar construction is possible for \u03b1 (Q)< 2 n/5. We also show that this problem with \u03b1 (Q)\u2265 2 n/5 and k satisfying\u230a n/3\u230b\u2264 k\u2264 \u03b1 (Q) can be related to semi-equitable graph 3-coloring, where one color class is of size k, and the subgraph induced by the remaining vertices is equitably 2-colored. This means that Q has a coloring of type (k,\u2308(n\u2212 k)/2\u2309,\u230a(n\u2212 k)/2\u230b).",

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a potential solution to safeguard privacy through cryptographic means while allowing the service providers to perform computations on the encrypted data. Throughout the process, only authorized users have access to the unencrypted data. In this paper, we provide an overview of three recent HE schemes, analyze the new optimization techniques, conduct performance evaluation, and share lessons learnt from the process of implementing these schemes.

Geosocial networks, as an example, offer the ability to notify a user or trigger a service when a friend is within geographical proximity. In this paper, we present two methods to support secure distance computation on encrypted location data; that is, computing distance functions without knowing the actual coordinates of users. The underlying security is ensured by the homomorphic encryption scheme which supports computation on encrypted data. We demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approaches by conducting various performance evaluations on platforms with different specifications.

Many modern block ciphers are based on the substitution permutation network (SPN) design. The substitution step is commonly the only non-linear transformation in the cipher, and is usually comprised of a permutation which applies an S-box substitution to each element of the cipher state. In hardware, the S-box implementation has a significant impact on the area consumed by the cipher. Consequently, there have been considerable research and engineering efforts to obtain compact circuit implementations of S-boxes for hardware systems. Building on past work, we present a comprehensive methodology for (1) constructing cryptographically strong affine-power S-boxes over Galois fields and (2) minimizing the VLSI technology-independent combinational logic requirements for their circuit\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "With the continuous growth of cyberinfrastructure throughout modern society, the need for secure computing and communication is more important than ever before. As a result, there is also an increasing need for entry-level developers who are capable of designing and building practical solutions for systems with stringent security requirements. This calls for careful attention to algorithm choice and implementation method, as well as trade-offs between hardware and software implementations. This article describes motivation and efforts taken by three departments at Rochester Institute of Technology (Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Software Engineering) that were focused on creating a multidisciplinary course that integrates the algorithmic, engineering, and practical aspects of security as exemplified by applied cryptography. In particular, the article presents the structure of this new course, topics\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "A number of key management challenges are encountered when operating tactical communication systems using a group-wide shared key. A large portion of such communications occurs over low bit-rate channels, and all communication channels must be available at any moment for mission action. Current over-the-air rekeying protocols consume too much channel bit-rate to be practical for large tactical radio networks. This caused an off-line pre-placed key (PPK) approach to become most commonly used key distribution method in these environments. Unfortunately, with this key management scheme, revoking group membership requires a full intra-mission rekey, which can be dangerous in a battlefield situation. This paper introduces a new group key distribution method called Viral Electronic Key Exchange (VEKE). This paper examines the protocol as an extension to the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, but any electronic key exchange protocol can be used (Ex. IKE v2). A feature of this protocol is a parallel key distribution scheme enabled by propagating the key management role to authenticated nodes while establishing security associations across the network. We performed a comprehensive stochastic analysis to develop a model for computing the expected rekey time across the entire group, taking into account the likelihood of node jamming, channel failures, and message corruption. This model was verified with a Monte-Carlo simulation. Our results confirmed that the VEKE protocol can accomplish an over-the-air rekey in a short period of time, even over low bit-rate systems, while preserving rigid security and channel availability\u00a0\u2026"

For the multicolor Ramsey numbers, we focus on the growth of R  r (k), in particular for k\u2009=\u20093.

Finding such a graph involves solving a special case of the classical Ramsey arrowing operation. Folkman proved the existence of these graphs in 1970, and they are now called Folkman graphs. Erd\\H{o}s offered \\$100 for deciding if one exists with less than $10^{10}$ vertices. This problem remained open until 1988 when Spencer, in a seminal paper using probabilistic techniques, proved the existence of a Folkman graph of order $3\\times 10^9$ (after an erratum), without explicitly constructing it. In 2008, Dudek and R\\\"{o}dl developed a strategy to construct new Folkman graphs by approximating the maximum cut of a related graph, and used it to improve the upper bound to 941. We improve this bound first to 860 using their approximation technique and then further to 786 with the MAX-CUT semidefinite programming relaxation as used in the Goemans-Williamson algorithm.",

All of them are improvements by one over the previously best known bounds. Let e(3,k,n) denote the minimum number of edges in any triangle-free graph on n vertices without independent sets of order k. The new upper bounds on R(3,k) are obtained by completing the computation of the exact values of e(3,k,n) for all n with k <= 9 and for all n <= 33 for k = 10, and by establishing new lower bounds on e(3,k,n) for most of the open cases for 10 <= k <= 15. The enumeration of all graphs witnessing the values of e(3,k,n) is completed for all cases with k <= 9. We prove that the known critical graph for R(3,9) on 35 vertices is unique up to isomorphism. For the case of R(3,10), first we establish that R(3,10) = 43 if and only if e(3,10,42) = 189, or equivalently, that if R(3,10) = 43 then every critical graph is regular of degree 9. Then, using computations, we disprove the existence of the latter, and thus show that R(3,10) <= 42.",

The aggregate loads of the GPU and CPU impact the performance of each application. This work investigates the effects of CPU and GPU loads on the performance of two CUDA GPU applications with significantly different CPU-GPU interaction profiles: implementations of the AES encryption and Keccak hashing algorithms. The percentage degradation in performance of these applications from CPU and GPU loads indicates dependence on the total execution time of the application, with the greatest degradation for the shortest execution times. Performance degradations as high as 22% and 36% were observed for CPU and GPU loads, respectively.",

        "description": "A hash function H:{0, 1}\u2217\u2192{0, 1} m produces an m-bit digest of an arbitrary message, file, or even an entire file system. Typically, one wants hash functions to be easy to compute, but also infeasible to invert or to find collisions (pairs of inputs which hash to the same value). Hash functions are fundamental cryptographic primitives, and they are used extensively in authentication, preserving data integrity, digital signatures, and many other security applications. The two most widely used hash functions are MD5 (Message Digest, m= 128) and SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm, m= 160), the latter supported by the US government as a standard FIPS-180-2. The collisions for MD5 were found four years ago, and by now they can be produced quickly by software available on the Net. The SHA-1 algorithm seems also to be in trouble (and other algorithms in the SHA family, with m= 256, 384,512, might follow). No collisions for SHA-1 have been found so far, but attacks much better than the simple birthday attack approach have been designed. Breaking SHA-1 soon is a likely possibility.On January 23, 2007, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) announced an initiative to design a new hash for this century, the Advanced Hash Standard (AHS), to be dubbed SHA-3. The competition is open, submissions were due October 31, 2008, and it is planned to conclude in late 2012."

The NTRU (Nth degree truncated polynomial ring) encrypt algorithm has been shown to provide certain advantages when designing low power and resource constrained systems, while still providing comparable security levels to higher complexity algorithms. Unlike the current works that build NTRU software in a chip, this research focuses on the hardware implementation of NTRU algorithms because hardware implementation has much higher execution speed than software implementation. In contrast to previous research, the focus is shifted away from specific optimizations but rather provides a study of many of the recommended practices and suggested optimizations with particular emphasis on polynomial arithmetic and parameter selection\u00a0\u2026",

These developments are quite similar to the recent history of symmetric block ciphers\u2014 breaking of the DES (Data Encryption Standard) and emergence of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in 2001 as the winner of a multiyear NIST competition. In this paper we make a case that parallelizability should be one of the properties sought in the new SHA-3 design. We present a design concept for a parallelizable hash function called PHASH based on a block cipher, and we discuss PHASH\u2019s performance and security.",

        "description": "Given a set of n points in general position in the plane, where n is even, a halving line is a line going through two of the points and cutting the remaining set of n\u2212 2 points in half. Let h (n) denote the maximum number of halving lines that can be realized by a planar set of n points. The problem naturally generalizes to pseudoconfigurations; denote the maximum number of halving pseudolines over all pseudoconfigurations of size n by h \u0302 (n). We prove that h \u0302 (12)= 18 and that the pseudoconfiguration on 12 points with the largest number of halving pseudolines is unique up to isomorphism; this pseudoconfiguration is realizable, implying h (12)= 18. We show several structural results that substantially reduce the computational effort needed to obtain the exact value of h \u0302 (n) for larger n. Using these techniques, we enumerate all topologically distinct, simple arrangements of 10 pseudolines with a marked cell. We\u00a0\u2026",

        "description": "Optimization problems involving a large number of finite solutions often arise in academia, government, and industry. In these problems there is a finite solution set X and a real-valued function f: X\u2192 R where we seek a solution x\u2217\u2208 X with f (x\u2217)\u2264 f (x),\u2200 x\u2208 X. Common examples include crew scheduling, vehicle routing, and VLSI routing. To find the globally optimal solution in a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem it is theoretically possible to enumerate all possible solutions and evaluate each. This approach is generally undesirable as well as intractable due to the exponential growth of most solution spaces. A simple search of any technical database will quickly demonstrate that a lot of research has been devoted over the past five or so decades to find and develop optimal or near-optimal algorithms that can quickly and efficiently find a solution without evaluating every possible solution.

        "description": "With the help of the computer, we have shown that in any coloring with two colors of the triangles on a set of 13 points there must exist a monochromatic tetrahedron. This proves the new upper bound R (4, 4; 3) 13. The previous best upper bound of 15 was derived independently by Giraud (1969 [2]), Schwenk (1978 [5]) and Sidorenko (1980 [6]). The first construction of a R (4, 4; 3)-good hypergraph on 12 points was presented by Isbell (1969 [3]), and the same one again more elegantly by Sidorenko (1980 [6]). We have constructed more than 200,000 R (4, 4; 3)-good hypergraphs on 12 points, but probably not the full set. R (4, 4; 3)= 13 is the first known exact value of a classical Ramsey number for hypergraphs.The solution was achieved with the help of a variety of algorithms relying on a strong connection between the colorings with two colors of the triangles on n points and the so-called Tur\u00e1n set systems T (n, 5, 4). The main criterion used to prune the search space for R (4, 4; 3)-good hypergraphs was to count the number of 4-sets containing two triangles of each color; such families of 4-sets are known to form Tur\u00e1n systems and their cardinalities must be minorized by the corresponding Tur\u00e1n numbers T (n, 5, 4). We used an innovative method for generating large families of set systems which efficiently prevents isomorphic copies of set systems being produced. This method has many potential applications to other general computer searches for elusive combinatorial configurations. As a check on the correctness of the algorithms, many of the intermediate subfamilies of R (4, 4; 3)-good hypergraphs were generated by two different methods\u00a0\u2026"

In particular, the exact value of the minimal independence ratio for graphs with average degree 4 is shown to be 4/13.

To find a graph on n vertices with no clique of k vertices, Kk, and no independent set of l vertices, \u00afKl, k, l \u2264 n, with an automorphism group G, a Boolean formula \u03b1 based on the G\u2010orbits of k\u2010subsets and l\u2010subsets of vertices is constructed from incidence matrices belonging to G. This Boolean formula is satisfiable if and only if the desired graph exists, and each satisfying assignment to \u03b1 specifies a set of orbits of pairs of vertices whose union gives the edges of such a graph. Finding these assignments is basically equivalent to the conversion of \u03b1 from CNF to DNF (conjunctive to disjunctive normal form). Though the latter problem is NP\u2010hard, we present an \u201cefficient\u201d method to do the conversion for the formulas that appear in this particular problem.

The idea of applying the L^ 3 algorithm to the subset sum problem is due to Lagarias and Odlyzko [8]. The algorithm of this paper also uses a direct search for short vectors simultaneously with the basis reduction algorithm. Extensive computational tests show that this algorithm solves, with high probability, instances of low density subset sum problems and has two major advantages over the method of Lararias and Odlyzko: running time is an order of magnitude smaller and higher density subset sum problems are solved.",

        "description": "With the help of computer algorithms, we improve the upper bound on the classical three color Ramsey number R (3, 3, 4), and thus we show that the exact value of this number is 30 or 31. We also present computer enumeration of all 3-colorings of edges on at least 14 vertices without monochromatic triangles.1. Introduction and Notation An (r\u00ca, r\u00cb,..., r\u00cd) colori\u03b7g, r\u00d4> 1 for 1< i< k, is an assignment of one of k colors to each edge in a complete graph, such that it does not contain monochromatic complete subgraph \u00da\u00dc\u00dd in color i, for 1< i< k. Similarly, an (r\u00ca, r\u00cb,..., r\u00cd; \u03b7) colori\u03b7g is an (r \u00ca,..., r\u00cd) coloring of \u00da\u00e3. Let Z (r \u00ca,..., r\u00cd) and Z (r \u00ca,..., r\u00cd; \u03b7) denote the set of all (r\u00ca,..., r\u00cd) and (r\u00ca,..., r\u00cd; \u03b7) colorings, respectively. The Ramsey number R (r\u00ca,..., r\u00cd) is defined to be the least \u03b7> 0 such that Z (r\u00ca,..., r\u00cd; \u03b7) is empty. A coloring using k colors will be also called a k-coloring. Clearly, any 2-coloring can be considered as a graph. In this paper we will study k-colorings only for k= 2 or k= 3. In the former case we will also use standard graph theory terminology. A regularly updated survey of the most recent results on the best known bounds on multicolor (k> 2) and graph (k= 2) Ramsey numbers can be found in [Rad]. In 1966 Kalbfleisch [Kalb] constructed a cyclic (3, 3, 4; 29) coloring, which to date gives the best known lower bound R (3, 3, 4)> 30. Recently, Piwakowski [Piw] obtained an upper bound R (3, 3, 4)< 32. In this paper we reduce this bound to 31, and we conjecture that the exact value of this Ramsey number is 30. We note that the only known nontrivial value of a multicolor classical (ie avoiding monochromatic complete subgraphs) Ramsey number is R (3, 3, 3\u00a0\u2026"

The roof is obtained by using computer algorithms to analyze the properties of the amily of TZ having no Ka-e and having no KS-e in the complement. It is also shown that there is a unique graph, up to graph isomorphism, which is extremal for R (Ke, K7-e), viz., the strongly regular Schl\u00e5fli graph on 27 vertices, which has an automorphism group of size 51840.

        "description": "With the growing popularity of mobile devices that have sophisticated localization capability, it becomes more convenient and tempting to give away location data in exchange for recognition and status in the social networks. Geosocial networks, as an example, offer the ability to notify a user or trigger a service when a friend is within geographical proximity. To achieve this, users\u2019 devices need to periodically send location updates to the service provider, which then computes the geographical distance in an unencrypted form. Existing privacy preserving mechanisms focus on the storage or release of coordinate data by means of classical encryption and differential privacy. These techniques limit the utility of the encrypted or synthesized data if further computations are needed. In this paper, we present two methods to support secure distance computation on encrypted location data; that is, computing distance functions without knowing the actual coordinates of users. The underlying security is ensured by the homomorphic encryption scheme which supports computation on encrypted data. We demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approaches by conducting various performance evaluations on platforms with different specifications. We argue that the novelty of this work enables a new breed of pervasive and mobile computing concepts, which was previously not possible due to the lack of feasible mechanisms that support computation on encrypted location data."
