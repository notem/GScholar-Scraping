        "description": "Traffic volume surveying is a crucial activity to get traffic statistics for road management and traffic congestion control. In recent years, the target environment of traffic volume surveying has become more complex, such as the fully automated surveillance of many-way intersections. Further compounding this complexity, some local governments may not be able to install a camera at a high enough elevation to capture the entire intersection due to environmental, legal, safety, or cost restrictions. Therefore, bigger objects such as buses and trucks often occlude other vehicles in the captured image. This occlusion degrades the accuracy of counting and is one of the main problems that makes the automation of traffic counting at intersections difficult. In this work, we propose a Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) transformation method capable of 1) removing camera distortion created by wide-angle cameras installed at lower elevations\u00a0\u2026"

The purpose of fusion is to capitalize on the advantages of each modality while minimizing its weaknesses. Advanced deep neural network (DNN)-based fusion techniques have demonstrated the exceptional and industry-leading performance. Due to the redundant information in multiple modalities, MSF is also recognized as a general defence strategy against adversarial attacks.  In this paper, we attack fusion models from the camera modality that is considered to be of lesser importance in fusion but is more affordable for attackers. We argue that the weakest link of fusion models depends on their most vulnerable modality and propose an attack framework that targets advanced camera-LiDAR fusion-based 3D object detection models through camera-only adversarial attacks.  Our approach employs a two-stage optimization-based strategy that first thoroughly evaluates vulnerable image areas under adversarial attacks, and then applies dedicated attack strategies for different fusion models to generate deployable patches. The evaluations with six advanced camera-LiDAR fusion models and one camera-only model indicate that our attacks successfully compromise all of them. Our approach can either decrease the mean average precision (mAP) of detection performance from 0.824 to 0.353 or degrade the detection score of a target object from 0.728 to 0.156, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed attack framework.

To counter obfuscation, a number of logical (e.g. Boolean satisfiability) and physical (e.g. electro-optical probing) attacks have been proposed. By definition, these attacks use only a subset of the information leaked by a circuit to unlock it. Countermeasures often exploit the resulting blind-spots to thwart these attacks, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To overcome this, we propose a combined logical and physical attack against obfuscation called the CLAP attack. The CLAP attack leverages both the logical and physical properties of a locked circuit to prune the keyspace in a unified and theoretically-rigorous fashion, resulting in a more versatile and potent attack. To formulate the physical portion of the CLAP attack, we derive a logical formulation that provably identifies input sequences capable of\u00a0\u2026",

However, prior logic locking research proposes configuring logic locking using only module level considerations. To begin our work, we perform a systematic design space exploration of logic locking in modules throughout a processor IC. This exploration shows that locking with only module level considerations cannot guarantee architecture/application level security, regardless of the locking technique used. To remedy this, we propose a tool-driven security-aware approach to enhance the 2 most effective candidate locking locations, on-chip memory and data path. We show that through minor design modifications of the on-chip memory and data path architecture, one can exponentially improve the architecture/application level security of prior locking art with only a modest design overhead. Underlying our design space exploration and security-aware design approach is ObfusGEM, an open-source logic locking simulation framework released with this work to quantitatively evaluate the architectural effectiveness of logic locking in custom processor architecture configurations."

However, prior logic locking research proposes configuring logic locking using only module level considerations. To begin our work, we perform a systematic design space exploration of logic locking in modules throughout a processor IC. This exploration shows that locking with only module level considerations cannot guarantee architecture/application level security, regardless of the locking technique used. To remedy this, we propose a tool-driven security-aware approach to enhance the 2 most effective candidate locking locations, on-chip memory and data path.

        "description": "To protect against an untrusted foundry, logic locking must 1) inject sufficient error to ensure critical application failures for any wrong key (error severity) and 2) resist any attack against it (attack resilient). We begin our work by deriving a fundamental tradeoff between these two goals which exists underlying all logic locking, regardless of construction. This relationship forces integrated circuit (IC) designers to sacrifice the error severity of logic locking to increase its attack resilience and vice versa. We proceed by exploring the consequences of this tradeoff through architectural simulations of ICs incorporating locking sweeping over the derived parametric space. We find that the efficacy of logic locking is severely limited by this tradeoff. In response, we propose trace logic locking (TLL), a novel enhancement of module level logic locking which enables existing art to secure arbitrary length sequences of input minterms\u00a0\u2026",

Many conventional SAT-resilient logic locking schemes fail to inject sufficient error into the circuit when the key is incorrect: there are usually very few (or only one) input minterms that cause any error at the circuit output [18], [20]\u2013[22].

Such threats severely undermine the benefits of the fabless model. Among the countermeasures developed to thwart piracy and RE attacks, logic locking has emerged as a promising and versatile solution that is being adopted by both academia and industry. The idea behind logic locking is to lock the design using a \u201ckeying\u201d mechanism; only the rightful owner has control over the locked design. Therefore, the design remains nonfunctional without the knowledge of the key. In this article, we survey the evolution of logic locking over the last decade.

Therefore, for combinational, module-level locking, increases in application-level error rates are accompanied by a corresponding increase in SAT susceptibility and vice versa. To address this, we introduce an automated and attack-resistant obfuscation technique, called memory locking, which targets on-chip SRAM.

Therefore, fine-grained thermal-aware management (TM) techniques for HMCs are gaining increasing research interests. In order to design an efficient TM technique, a myriad of simulations should be performed at the early stage. However, current TM simulations for HMCs depend on complex frameworks which involve different tools.

But one challenge will be exposing sufficient parallelism to keep all of the on-chip compute resources fully utilized. In this paper, we argue that integrated CPU-GPU chips should exploit parallelism from multiple loops simultaneously. One example of this is nested parallelism in which one or more inner SIMD loops are nested underneath a parallel outer (non-SIMD) loop. By scheduling the parallel outer loop on multiple CPU cores, multiple dynamic instances of the inner SIMD loops can be scheduled on the GPU cores. This boosts GPU utilization and parallelizes the non-SIMD code.
