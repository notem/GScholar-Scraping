As 41 states across the United States have adopted accessibility policies, affecting 82% of the nation, the pursuit of inclusivity goes beyond mere compliance with regulations. However, despite the significant presence of disabilities, computer science students often remain minimally exposed to the challenges of developing technology through the lens of individuals with disabilities [5]. This deficiency highlights the critical importance of embedding empathy and user-centered perspectives into their educational framework.

Tactic examples include the implementation of additional security measures when an intrusion is detected, or activating a cooling mechanism when temperature thresholds are surpassed. Tactic volatility occurs in real-world systems and is defined as variable behavior in the attributes of a tactic, such as its latency or cost. A system's inability to effectively account for tactic volatility adversely impacts its efficiency and resiliency against the dynamics of real-world environments. To enable systems' efficiency against tactic volatility, we propose a Tactic Volatility Aware (TVA-E) process utilizing evolved Recurrent Neural Networks (eRNN) to provide accurate tactic predictions. TVA-E is also the first known process to take advantage of uncertainty reduction tactics to provide additional information to the decision-making process and reduce uncertainty. TVA\u00a0\u2026",

The irrelevant period degrades the classification performance while the relevance is unknown to the system. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware multiple instance learning (MIL) framework to identify the most relevant period automatically. The predictive uncertainty enables designing an attention mechanism that forces the MIL model to learn from the possibly discriminant period. Moreover, the predicted uncertainty yields a principled estimator to identify whether a prediction is trustworthy or not. We further incorporate another modality to accommodate unreliable predictions by training a separate model based on its availability and conduct uncertainty aware\u00a0\u2026",

Compounding this problem, there is a lack of robust, easily adoptable educational accessibility material available to instructors for inclusion in their curricula. To address these issues, we have created five Accessibility Learning Labs (ALL) using an experiential learning structure. The labs are designed to educate and create awareness of accessibility needs in computing. The labs enable easy classroom integration by providing instructors with complete educational materials including lecture slides, activities, and quizzes.

In many cases, these systems must adapt to properly react to numerous scenarios. This adaptivity could be a simple action such as activating an additional server, or could be incredibly complex in creating a completely new adaptation strategy. In the following work, we address the question \"Is Adaptability a Core Property of Intelligent Systems?\" We determine that due to the ambiguity of the term 'intelligent system' and the wide range of such systems, that there is no clear and definitive answer to this question. This paper details the deliberation of three AI/Self-Adaptive researchers in addressing this question. We use several scenarios of intelligent systems ranging from a simple motion detector to a complex 'humanoid' futuristic artificial system to demonstrate the complexity of this question.",

        "description": "Android is built upon a permission-based structure, where apps require access to specific permissions in order to carry out specific functionality. While Android has provided a set of best practices intended to aid the developer in properly defining and manipulating these permissions on their source code, developers do not always adhere to these guidelines. Although some of the resulting issues may be minor and lead to slight user confusion, other mistakes may create more serious privacy and security related issues. We've defined improper usage of these permission best practices to be 'permission smells' to indicate possible permissions related syntactic issues and have created a tool P-Lint to assist in the identification of these smells on the source code. P-Lint's goal is to not only help developers create better, more secure apps by providing guidance on properly using permissions, but also in allowing\u00a0\u2026",

Unfortunately, there is no built-in verification system to ensure that apps do not request too many or too few permissions, which could lead to serious quality and/or privacy concerns. Apps requesting too many permissions create unnecessary vulnerabilities, leaving the potential for abuse by SDKs within the app or other malicious apps installed on the device. In order to assist with the discovery of misused permissions, we created a new detection tool, M-Perm, which combines static and dynamic analysis in a computationally efficient manner compared to existing tools. M-Perm also identifies permission usage in apps including requested normal, dangerous, and 3rd party permissions.

Are they experienced developers with the appropriate project knowledge to make such important decisions, or are these crucial choices being made by those with relatively minor amounts of contributions to the project?

Users frequently make their app choices based on the ratings of apps in comparison with similar, often competing apps. Users also expect apps to continually provide new features while maintaining quality, or the ratings drop. At the same time apps must also be secure, but is there a historical trade-off between security and ratings? Or are app store ratings a more all-encompassing measure of product maturity? We used static analysis tools to collect security-related metrics in 38,466 Android apps from the Google Play store. We compared the rate of an app's permission misuse, number of requested permissions, and Androrisk score, against its user rating.   We found that high-rated apps have statistically significantly higher security risk metrics than low-rated apps. However, the correlations are weak. This result supports the\u00a0\u2026",

Unfortunately, this is a non-trivial task for even experienced developers. Developers often resort to using search engines, crowd-sourcing websites, or discussion forums to find sample code snippets. A robust Tactic Search Engine can replace this manual, internet-based search process and help developers to reuse proper architectural knowledge and accurately implement tactics and patterns from a wide range of open source systems.

        "description": "Software engineering students typically dislike testing. In part this is due to the simplicity of the programming and design exercises in introductory computing courses - the payoff for thorough testing is not apparent. In addition, testing can be seen as tangential to what really matters: developing and documenting a design addressing the requirements, and constructing a system in conforming to the design. Such dismissive attitudes do not accord well with the realities of commercial software development. The cost of fixing, repairing and redistributing a flawed product can dwarf that of development. The Software Engineering Department at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) teaches (and requires) basic testing as part of its foundation courses in the first two years. In addition, it offers an upper division course on testing, giving an in-depth treatment of best-practice tools, techniques and processes. Recently we've\u00a0\u2026",

Prior research has shown that clones can be harmful since they elevate maintenance costs, increase the number of bugs caused by inconsistent changes to cloned code and may decrease programmer compre-hensibility due to the increased size of the code base. To assist in the detection of code clones, we propose a new tool known as Concolic Code Clone Discovery (CCCD). CCCD is the first known clone detection tool that uses concolic analysis as its primary component and is one of only three known techniques which are able to reliably detect the most complicated kind of clones, type-4 clones.",

        "description": "Student retention is a challenge faced by all engineering programs. Our first year software engineering students have schedules filled with computer science, mathematics, science and humanities. The lack of any exposure to engineering meant some students, expressing a dislike for software engineering, left the program before they had any exposure to the discipline. To address this issue, we created a one credit Software Engineering Freshman Seminar, which all entering students take in their first term at RIT. This lets us insure student/faculty contact early in the program, as well as providing an opportunity to introduce engineering concepts and practices early in each student's program of study. This paper discusses the seminar's current incarnation. In particular, we focus on those aspects of the course which help students identify with software engineering as a profession. The challenge we face is achieving this\u00a0\u2026",

Since a same bug can be repeatedly triggered by different users, an overwhelming number of crash dumps are returned daily. Techniques for automatically grouping crash dumps are mostly based on call stacks captured at crash sites; although fast, they can incorrectly group irrelevant crash dumps or miss related crash dumps. The goal of this paper is to compare manually and automatically grouped crash dumps and discover grouping criteria that are effectively used in manual diagnosis but lacking in automatic tools, from which we potentially enable more precise and capable crash diagnostic tools. In our study, we compared a total of 1,550 groups and 30,431 crash dumps from 5 Mozilla applications. We find that 1) call stacks are more dissimilar from each other in manual groups, as besides\u00a0\u2026",

Concolic analysis, a hybrid software verification technique which performs symbolic execution along with a concrete execution path, has been used for a variety of purposes including software testing, code clone detection, and security-related activities. We created a new publicly available concolic analysis tool for analyzing Android applications: Concolic Android TEster (CATE). Building on Java Path Finder (JPF-SPF), this tool performs concolic analysis on a raw Android application file (or source code) and provides output in a useful and easy to understand format."

        "description": "Android is built upon a permission-based structure, where apps require access to specific permissions in order to carry out specific functionalities. While Android has provided a set of best practices intended to aid the developer in properly defining and manipulating these permissions on their source code, developers do not always adhere to these guidelines. Although some of the resulting issues may be minor and lead to slight user confusion, other mistakes may create more serious privacy and security related issues. We\u2019ve defined improper usage of these permission best practices to be permission smells to indicate possible permissions related syntactic issues and have created a tool P-Lint to assist in the identification of these smells on the source code. P-Lint\u2019s goal is to not only help developers create better, more secure apps by providing guidance on properly using permissions, but also in allowing researchers to better understand the common permission smells through empirical analysis on existing apps. P-Lint is publicly available on the project website: https://p-lint. github. io"
