        "description": "When disasters happen, the speed with which first responders and emergency personnel can contact and be contacted by the people affected by the disaster during the first minutes or hours is critical. Early communications can make the difference between life and death. During a disaster communications infrastructure of the affected area is likely to be compromised. This project proposes an inexpensive, rapidly deployable cloud of autonomous drones, each coupled with a micro-cellular base station that deploys from a transportable deployment module. The goal is to temporarily restore communications for both first responders to communicate amongst themselves as well as for the rest of the impacted population."

This covert channel proved to be capable of a much higher throughput than any other comparable channels which had been explored previously. This article will expand on the work which was started in [1]. Specifically, further improvements on the initial covert channel concept will be detailed and their impact with regards to channel throughput will be evaluated. In addition, a new protocol for managing connections and communications between collaborating applications purely using this channel will be defined and explored. A number of different potential mechanisms and techniques for detecting the presence and use of this covert channel will also be described and discussed, including possible counter-measures which could be implemented.

The reserved country codes can act as a delimiter indicating that a secret message is being sent. By spoofing a call using a reserved country code number, the application listening on the mobile device will be able to intercept the call and extract information from the remaining digits based on ASCII encoding in a decimal format. The purpose of using a reserved country code number is so that there will be no denied service to the user with a call from a legitimate phone number."

Smartphones are subject to traditional computer network covert channel techniques. Smartphones also introduce new sets of covert channel techniques as they add more capabilities and multiple network connections. This work presents a new network covert channel in smartphones. The research studies the ability to leak information from the smartphones applications by reaching the cellular voice stream, and it examines the ability to employ the cellular voice channel to be a potential medium of information leakage through carrying modulated speech-like data covertly. To validate the theory, an Android software audio modem has been developed and it was able to leak data successfully through the cellular voice channel stream by carrying modulated data with a throughput of 13 bps with 0.018% BER. Moreover, Android security policies are investigated and broken in order to implement a user-mode rootkit that opens the voice channels by stealthily answering an incoming voice call. Multiple scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed covert channel. This study identifies a new potential smartphone covert channel, and discusses some security vulnerabilities in Android OS that allow the use of this channel demonstrating the need to set countermeasures against this kind of breach.",

The NECCDC has been hosted on a rotating basis by one of the universities in the northeast and has become a popular event for both the hosting schools and for the students. We feel that the NECCDC has continued to be an exciting event in part because it has been hosted by different universities which have all made important contributions to the event.

        "description": "Loop free frame forwarding in layer 2 switched networks that use meshed topologies to provision for link and path redundancy is a continuing challenge. The challenge is addressed through special protocols at layer 2 that build logical trees over the physically meshed topologies, along which frames can be forwarded. The first such protocol was based on the spanning tree. The spanning tree protocol (STP) had high convergence times subsequent to topology changes. Rapid STP and IETF RFC 5556 Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) on Router Bridges (RBridges) were then developed to reduce the convergence times. RSTP continued to use the spanning tree while TRILL adopted link state routing to support a tree from every switch. TRILL introduces high processing complexity into layer 2 networks. In this article a new meshed tree algorithm (MTA) and a loop avoidance protocol based on the MTA, namely the meshed tree protocol (MTP) are discussed. The MTA allows constructing several overlapping trees from a single root switch. This speeds up convergence to link failures. The MTP proposes a simple numbering scheme to implement meshed trees\u2013thus, the processing complexity is low. The specification for the MTP is currently an ongoing IEEE standard Project 1910.1. In this article the operational details of MTP are presented and its performance evaluated and compared with RSTP."

MODBUS is one of the most used communication protocols in industrial control systems. Even though the protocol itself is known to lack basic security features; there is not much detail available about real world cases where MODBUS has been used as an attack vector. Covert channels have been mentioned several times as part of the security vulnerabilities of SCADA systems [1],[2] and [4]. This research targets the MODBUS protocol characteristics to introduce a covert channel. This covert channel allows information leakage from one device called covert Master to another one called covert Slave. The covert Master is supposed to be on the internal LAN, while the covert Slave is expected to be on a separate subnet. The Slaves subnet could be based on either Ethernet and TCP/IP or a serial BUS (RS485) using a media converter to reach the LAN.",

In recent years, new and innovative methods have been proposed to aid in the detection of covert channels. Existing detection schemes are often too specific and are ineffective against new covert channels. In this paper, we expound upon previous work done with timing channels and apply it to detecting covert storage channels. Our approach is based on the assumption that the entropy of covert channels will vary from that of previously observed, legitimate, communications. This change in the entropy of a process provides us with a method for identifying storage channels. Using this assumption we created proof of concept code capable of detecting various covert storage channels. The results of our experiments demonstrate that we can successfully detect existing and\u00a0\u2026",

This study takes an in-depth look at how five different vendors: Cisco, Extreme, Linksys, VMWare, and Vyatta, implement the translation table during active NAT sessions. Additionally, this study analyzes the methodology required to fill a translation table and the Denial of Service that is a result of the attack.

For spies and terrorist cells, this quality can be the difference between life and death. However, even the detection of communications in a botnet could be troublesome for its creators. To evade detection and prevent insights into the size and members of a botnet, covert channels can be used. A botnet should rely on covert channels built on ubiquitous protocols to blend in with legitimate traffic. In this paper, we propose a covert channel built on the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol. In a simple application, this covert channel can be used to discretely and covertly send messages between two parties. However, this covert channel can also be used to stealthily distribute commands or the location of a command and control server for use in a botnet.",

With the vast amount of traffic on the internet, network protocols have become a common vehicle for covert channels, typically hiding information in the header fields of packets. Domain name service (DNS) packets contain a 32-bit time to live (TTL) fields for each response record. This is the number of seconds the entry is valid for before caching servers remove the entry. There is no prescribed value for this field making it an ideal covert carrier.",

These communication methods, or \u201ccovert channels\u201d, can be applied in a number of ways, including as a mechanism for an attacker to leak data from a monitored system or network. This paper sets out to contribute to this field by introducing a new covert channel which operates over transport layer protocols. The mechanism is flexible, covert, and has the potential to operate at relatively high bandwidth. In addition, this paper proposes a number of encoding schemes which can be used in conjunction with this channel to improve its bandwidth and covertness.",

For spies and terrorist cells, this quality can be the difference between life and death. However, even the detection of communications in a botnet could be troublesome for its creators. To evade detection and prevent insights into the size and members of a botnet, covert channels can be used. A botnet should rely on covert channels built on ubiquitous protocols to blend in with legitimate traffic. In this paper, we propose a covert channel built on the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol. In a simple application, this covert channel can be used to discretely and covertly send messages between two parties. However, this covert channel can also be used to stealthily distribute commands or the location of a command and control server for use in a botnet.",

This new technology does not (as of this writing) have a fully implemented independent interface to support end user control. Unlike cookies, there is not yet an interface for the user to block, alter or delete localStorage in web browsers. Nefarious users have files of data they utilize in their illegal activities that they need to preserve (stolen user information, credit card numbers, etc.). These users do not want to have a copy of this data on their personal machines in case of an investigation. Therefore, nefarious users are constantly looking for a new method to preserve and store this data, concealing it in such a way that it won\u2019t be associated with them but available when needed. Our project is to model this process by building a web application that would take a file, encrypt it, slice it up into 26 parts and distribute it to as many client systems as possible. At a later time, a second web application would watch for return visits by the holders of the parts of the original file and retrieve the parts as clients interact with the website. We would be studying the recidivism rate of clients returning to the website and the number of copies of each part distributed necessary to achieve a reliable recovery rate of the whole file. We will first test this prototype in a controlled laboratory setting to ensure that it works as intended. Next we have chosen two websites, the XXXX (http://XXX. XXX. edu/) and XXX (http://XXX. XXX. edu/) departmental\u00a0\u2026"

The paper will begin by identifying the skills and attributes needed for a Red Team and a process for selecting and recruiting members. The methods employed to form a cohesive working group from the members in the time available prior to the event will be discussed. The resources necessary for the Red Team to be effective and how they were provided is examined. We will look at how to promote planning and organization within the team focused on specific strategic goals and objectives of the Red Team. There are several duties during the event for a Red Team captain that will be examined and cautions that will be explained. At the end of the competition, the style and delivery of the after-action-report can have a profound effect on the Blue Teams. Experience with different approaches over the years will be examined. Recommendations for Red Team/Blue Team exchanges that can maximize the learning outcome for the students will be provided. Finally this paper will provide a summary of the experiences for others seeking to form and organize a Red Team either for a competition or an internal educational event.",

By using the RTP header, many of the challenges present for covert channels using the RTP payload are avoided. A reference implementation of this covert channel is presented.

A detailed sample implementation demonstrates an example of this type of covert channel in the form of a simple online two-person game.The potential of this type of covert channel is also discussed.",

Another emerging priority among these institutions is collaborative working environments. Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is among the many universities and colleges developing and offering Computer and Network Security curriculum. However, we believe that our innovative approach to this new curriculum is unique because of the collaborative nature of the \"ABC Defense Lab Project\" recently implemented across course boundaries. The Information Technology Department offers a Bachelor of Science Degree in Applied Networking and Systems Administration (ANSA). Within this degree, the curricula is distinctly segmented between the two areas. The networking curriculum studies the infrastructure that ties all the systems together.

ISS utilizes the capabilities of the Mistress Relational Database Management System, the Relation Interpreter Package and the CORE Graphics Package. The system was developed to illustrate that by utilizing a database system for the storage of the actual picture description, users can incorporate graphics into their applications very simply without becoming a graphics or programming expert. Through the database, image data can be shared between applications and changes or additions to the image will not require program modification. As a consequence of using a data base management system, graphical as well as nongraphical information may be stored together. An important out come of this is that the graphical data may be accessible for non-graphical purposes as well. The database schema is illustrated and its flexibility and user adaptability is demonstrated. The graphics image interpreter is described as well as the underlying Relation Interpreter Package on which it is built."

Secret messages could be embedded into one of the TCP/IP header fields and possibly not get detected by various firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS\u2019s). This paper proposes a novel covert channel utilizing the IP timestamp option inside an IPv4 packet header to exchange a secret message with another party."
