In this work, we propose HYPERDEGRADE\u2014a combination of previous approaches and the use of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) architectures. In addition to the new technique, we investigate the root causes of performance degradation using cache eviction, discovering a previously unknown slowdown origin. The slowdown produced is significantly higher than previous approaches, which translates into an increased time granularity for FLUSH+ RELOAD attacks. We evaluate HYPERDEGRADE on different Intel microarchitectures, yielding significant slowdowns that achieve, in select microbenchmark cases, three orders of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art. To evaluate the efficacy of performance degradation in side-channel amplification, we propose and evaluate leakage assessment metrics. The results evidence that HYPERDEGRADE increases time granularity without a meaningful impact on trace quality. Additionally, we designed a fair experiment that compares three performance degradation strategies when coupled with FLUSH+ RELOAD from an attacker perspective. We developed an attack on an unexploited vulnerability in OpenSSL in which HYPERDEGRADE excels\u2014reducing by three times the number of required FLUSH+ RELOAD traces to succeed.

However, in recent years, different attacks have appeared that are able to mislead the attestation process with treacherous practices as memory copy, proxy, and rootkit attacks, just to name a few. A successful attack leads to systems that are considered trusted by a verifier system, while the prover has bypassed the challenge. To mitigate these attacks against attestation methods and protocols, some proposals have considered the use of side-channel information that can be measured externally, as it is the case of electromagnetic (EM) emanation. Nonetheless, these methods require the physical proximity of an external setup to capture the EM radiation.In this paper, we present the possibility of performing attestation by using the side-channel information captured by a sensor or peripheral that lives in the same System-on-Chip (SoC) than the\u00a0\u2026",

Additionally, we collect the main remote power attacks performed so far from the literature, and the principal proposed countermeasures to avoid them. The search of such countermeasures denoted a clear gap in preventing remote power attacks at the technical level.

While there are a handful of outliers where all these concepts join and land in real-world deployments, these are generally on a case-by-case basis: e.g. a library may feature such X25519 or P-256 code, but not for all curves.

        "description": "An online template attack (OTA) is a powerful technique previously used to attack elliptic curve scalar multiplication algorithms. This attack has only been analyzed in the realm of power consumption and EM side channels, where the signals leak related to the value being processed. However, microarchitecture signals have no such feature, invalidating some assumptions from previous OTA works. In this paper, we revisit previous OTA descriptions, proposing a generic framework and evaluation metrics for any side-channel signal. Our analysis reveals OTA features not previously considered, increasing its application scenarios and requiring a fresh countermeasure analysis to prevent it. In this regard, we demonstrate that OTAs can work in the backward direction, allowing to mount an augmented projective coordinates attack with respect to the proposal by Naccache, Smart and Stern (Eurocrypt 2004). This demonstrates that randomizing the initial targeted algorithm state does not prevent the attack as believed in previous works. We analyze three libraries libgcrypt, mbedTLS, and wolfSSL using two microarchitecture side channels. For the libgcrypt case, we target its EdDSA implementation using Curve25519 twist curve. We obtain similar results for mbedTLS and wolfSSL with curve secp256r1. For each library, we execute extensive attack instances that are able to recover the complete scalar in all cases using a single trace. This work demonstrates that microarchitecture online template attacks are also very powerful in this scenario, recovering secret information without knowing a leakage model. This highlights the importance of developing\u00a0\u2026",

However, this attack has received little attention by the scientific community, and the status of deployed mitigations to prevent it in widely adopted cryptography libraries is unknown. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap, by analyzing several cryptography libraries in this context. To demonstrate the applicability of the attack, we use a side-channel attack to exploit this vulnerability within libgcrypt in the context of ECDSA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical attack instance. It targets the insecure binary extended Euclidean algorithm implementation using a microarchitectural side-channel attack that allows recovering the projective representation of the output point of scalar multiplication during ECDSA signature generation. We captured 100k traces to estimate the number of traces an attacker would need to compromise the libgcrypt ECDSA implementation, resulting in less than 2k for commonly used elliptic curve secp256r1, demonstrating the attack feasibility. During exploitation, we found two additional vulnerabilities. However, we remark the purpose of this paper is not merely exploiting a library but about providing an analysis on the projective coordinates vulnerability status in widely deployed open-source libraries, filling a gap between its original description in the academic literature and the adoption of countermeasures to thwart it in real-world applications.",

Intel SGX technology provides a strong isolation from an adversarial OS, however, does not guarantee protection against side-channel attacks. In this paper, we analyze the security of the mbedTLS binary GCD algorithm, an implementation that offers interesting challenges when compared for example with OpenSSL, due to the usage of very tight loops in the former. Using practical experiments we demonstrate the mbedTLS binary GCD implementation is vulnerable to side-channel analysis using the SGX-Step framework against mbedTLS based SGX enclaves. We analyze the security of some use cases of this algorithm in this library, resulting in the discovery of a new vulnerability in the ECDSA code path that allows a single-trace attack against this implementation. This vulnerability is three-fold interesting:* It resides in the implementation of a countermeasure which makes it more dangerous due to the false state of security the countermeasure currently offers.* It reduces mbedTLS ECDSA security to an integer factorization problem.* An unexpected GCD call inside the ECDSA code path compromises the countermeasure. We also cover an orthogonal use case, this time inside the mbedTLS RSA code path during the computation of a CRT parameter when loading a private key. The attack also exploits the binary GCD implementation threat, showing how a single vulnerable primitive leads to multiple vulnerabilities. We demonstrate both security threats with end-to-end attacks using 1000 trials each, showing in both cases single-trace attacks can be achieved with\u00a0\u2026",

We analyze two memory tampering proposals, illustrating how this technique can be adapted to different implementations.

Most of OpenSSL's constant-time code paths are driven by cryptosystem implementations enabling a dedicated flag at runtime. This process is perilous, with several examples emerging in the past few years of the flag either not being set or software defects directly mishandling the flag. In this work, we propose a methodology to analyze security-critical software for side-channel insecure code path traversal. Applying our methodology to OpenSSL, we identify three new code paths during RSA key generation that potentially leak critical algorithm state. Exploiting one of these leaks, we design, implement, and mount a single trace cache-timing attack on the GCD computation step. We overcome several hurdles in the process, including but not limited to:(1) granularity issues due to word-size operands to the GCD function;(2) bulk processing of desynchronized trace data;(3) non-trivial error rate during information extraction; and (4) limited high-confidence information on the modulus factors. Formulating lattice problem instances after obtaining and processing this limited information, our attack achieves roughly a 27% success rate for key recovery using the empirical data from 10K trials.",

Exploiting this defect, we target the errant modular inversion code path with a cache-timing and improved performance degradation attack, recovering the inversion state sequence. We propose a new approach of extracting a variable number of nonce bits from these sequences, and improve upon the best theoretical result to recover private keys in a lattice attack with as few as 50 signatures and corresponding traces.

In this work we disclose a vulnerability in OpenSSL, affecting all versions and forks (e.g. LibreSSL and BoringSSL) since roughly October 2005, which renders the implementation of the DSA signature scheme vulnerable to cache-based side-channel attacks. Exploiting the software defect, we demonstrate the first published cache-based key-recovery attack on these protocols: 260 SSH-2 handshakes to extract a 1024/160-bit DSA host key from an OpenSSH server, and 580 TLS 1.2 handshakes to extract a 2048/256-bit DSA key from an stunnel server.",

These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery\u2019s ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL\u2019s ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe\u00a0\u2026",

In the context of binary fields, this is an interesting option since there is extensive previous work on bit-oriented designs for arithmetic in hardware, such designs are intuitively well suited to bit-slicing in software.

        "description": "Side-channel analysis is a cryptanalytic technique that targets not the formal description of a cryptographic primitive but the implementation of it. Examples of side-channels include power consumption or timing measurements. This is a young but very active field within applied cryptography. Modern processors are equipped with numerous mechanisms to improve the average performance of a program, including but not limited to caches. These mechanisms can often be used as side-channels to attack software implementations of cryptosystems. This area within side-channel analysis is called microarchitecture attacks, and those dealing with caching mechanisms cache-timing attacks. This dissertation presents a number of contributions to the field of side-channel analysis. The introductory portion consists of a review of common cache architectures, a literature survey of covert channels focusing mostly on covert timing channels, and a literature survey of cache-timing attacks, including selective related results that are more generally categorized as side-channel attacks such as traditional timing attacks. This dissertation includes eight publications relating to this field. They contain contributions in areas such as side-channel analysis, data cache-timing attacks, instruction cache-timing attacks, traditional timing attacks, and fault attacks. Fundamental themes also include attack mitigations and efficient yet secure software implementation of cryptosystems. Concrete results include, but are not limited to, four practical side-channel attacks against OpenSSL, each implemented and leading to full key recovery.",

The attack exploits the cipher using the output from an S-box as input to another S-box: we show that the corresponding cache-timing data almost uniquely determines said S-box input. We mention other ciphers with similar structure where this attack applies, such as the K2 cipher currently under standardization consideration by ISO.

This is shown to significantly improve performance in comparison to processing the scalar multiplications individually. A practical application of the results is provided using Self-Certified signatures. These results are particularly useful when compact and fast signatures are needed.",

        "description": "Self-Certified keys provide an attractive alternative to traditional certificate-based public key infrastructures. Many self-certified key issuing protocols strive to blind trusted third parties to users\u2019 private keys. One such key issuing protocol is based on the Nyberg-Rueppel signature scheme, but requires a proof of knowledge to avoid impersonation attacks. This paper describes a version of this protocol that uses elliptic curves and eliminates the impersonation attacks and the proof of knowledge.",

Simultaneous elliptic scalar multiplication is a useful method of carrying out such verifications. This paper presents an efficient alternative to \u03c4-adic Joint Sparse Form that moves left-to-right for computations involving two points. A generalization of this algorithm is then presented for generating a low joint weight representation of an arbitrary number of integers.",

        "description": "Public key, or asymmetric, cryptography represents a major revolution in modern cryptography and the enabling factor in most modern digital communications and many other technologies based on online and offline authentication and authorization schemes. One of the main disadvantages of asymmetric cryptography over symmetric cryptography is the cost in terms of computation and memory required; elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), suggested independently by Miller [7] and Koblitz [4] since 1985, has seen increasingly wide adoption due to the vast improvements on both cost factors while providing the same level of security of \u201ctraditional\u201d public key cryptography. Nonetheless, asymmetric cryptography continues to be computationally expensive: new curves have been recently proposed to further improve ECC performances, and we focus our research on Curve25519 [2] and FourQ [3]. These two curves attain considerable performance improvements by taking into account hardware and implementation factors in the mathematical design of the curves, addressing the optimization of the underlying field operations and reducing the number of group operations involved in scalar multiplications.During our research we focus on OpenSSL, a popular software library widely adopted to provide cryptographic security, and measure the performance of the implementation of Curve25519 included in OpenSSL 1.1. 0. Finding that it does not meet the expected speed, we propose and benchmark the integration of an alternative implementation by A. Langley [6]. We also benchmark and propose the integration of the reference implementation of the FourQ\u00a0\u2026"
