Recently, a variant called posit was proposed to improve the precision around 1 and   . Since FP multiplication requires high computational complexity, various algorithmic approaches and hardware accelerator solutions have been explored. In this context, this article proposes a novel area-efficient logarithmic multiplier architecture for different real number formats, which also provides a significant and useful accuracy/latency tradeoff at runtime. To reduce the logic area in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), this article offers two innovations: applying logarithm to only a single operand and mitigating the accuracy drop caused by this modification with advanced error converging and operand selection schemes.

This structure, particularly cyber components and networks, makes it susceptible to malicious attacks. One of the solutions to this CPS security issue is to employ end-to-end homomorphic encryption (HE) that allows direct computations on encrypted data. Despite its promise, HE only supports basic operations, such as addition and multiplication, which limits its application areas. Numerical methods have been presented to perform a comparison operation in the HE domain. However, they suffer from a slow processing speed due to an inherently high number of iterations. To accelerate a homomorphic comparison operation, this paper introduces a novel approach that scales inputs using an asymmetric input range in thresholding. Additionally, parallelism in HE-based multilevel thresholding is explored\u00a0\u2026"

This design computes the reciprocal of a divisor in a hardware-friendly way. To correct approximation errors, multiple error biases are calculated based on error analysis and stored in a lookup table. The calculated reciprocal is multiplied by a dividend. For accuracy-configurability, an iterative logarithmic FP multiplier is adopted.

        "description": "Phase-change memory (PCM) is an emerging non-volatile memory device that offers faster access than flash memory does. However, PCM suffers from a critical problem where the number of write operations is limited. The previous practical attack detector (PAD) that uses a small memory space called stack adopts an algebraic mapping-based wear leveling (AWL) algorithm. Thanks to successful detection of malicious attacks, the PAD-AWL dramatically improves the lifetime of PCM. To enhance system factors such as write latency, the proposed method replaces the AWL algorithm with a table-based wear leveling (TWL) algorithm. Since the fixed stack size of the previous PAD is inefficient in detection of attack-like hot addresses, a stack size modulation scheme that enables a hot address detector (HAD) to efficiently counteract various memory write streams is proposed.

The proposed work approximates only one of the operands to reduce the number of logic blocks and iteratively compensates the approximation error to achieve acceptable error ranges in applications. To reduce the accuracy degradation by the single operand approximation, a rounding scheme and an operand selection scheme are additionally introduced. Compared with the widely-known previous iterative Mitchell design, our proposed SPFP multiplier design decreases the numbers of look up tables (LUTs) and flip flops (FFs) by 55% and 59% respectively, and shows two cycles shorter latency.

An RGBW display system, in general, uses a look-up table (LUT) for fast RGB-to-RGBW conversion. However, a large-sized LUT is implemented in external memory, which slows down system speed and increases power consumption. For robust LUT-based RGB-to-RGBW conversion, this brief proposes two schemes. First, the data mapping of the LUT is sub-sampled. For fast conversion, the sub-sampled data are approximately interpolated. Moreover, the interpolation performance is improved by using a refinement scheme. Second, a small internal buffer that caches the information from the LUT is used for the conversion. When the information stored in the buffer is used for conversion, the access to the LUT of the external memory is skipped\u00a0\u2026",

To store high-resolution video frames in external memory, the bus access time and the memory space are significant overheads for real-time video processing. There are many previous works which focus on data compression rates. However, in an actual system, several modules, including the video codec and the external memory, are connected via a system bus. In this environment, the gain in compression and the gain in transfer are very different. For a practical FMC design, not only the compression rate but also the transfer efficiency should be carefully considered. In this paper, a bus-aware interface design for one dimensional (1D) lossless FMC is proposed to reduce the amount of bus transfers.

This paper proposes a novel FMC design based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), which supports fine-scalable throughput and is area-efficient. In the proposed design, multi-cores with small block sizes are used in parallel instead of a single core with a large block size. In addition, an appropriate pipelining schedule is proposed. Compared to the previous design, the proposed design achieves the processing speed which is closer to the target system speed, and therefore it is more efficient in hardware utilization. In addition, a scheme in which two passes of SPIHT are merged into one pass called merged refinement pass (MRP) is proposed. As the number of shifters decreases and the bit-width of remained shifters is reduced, the size of SPIHT hardware significantly decreases. The proposed FMC encoder and decoder designs achieve the throughputs of 4,448 and 4,000 Mpixels/s, respectively, and their gate counts are 76.5 K and 107.8 K. When the proposed design is applied to high efficiency video codec (HEVC), it achieves 1.96% lower average BDBR and 0.05 dB higher average BDPSNR than the previous FMC design.",

To this end, the algorithm performs Golomb-Rice coding without any quantization of input data and then uses this coding result to estimate the codeword length with quantization.

By considering the specific domain of pedestrian trajectories, this paper presents two main contributions. First, as introduced in much of the work on trajectory-based anomaly detection in the literature, only information about pedestrian paths, such as direction and speed, is considered. Differing from previous work, this paper proposes a framework that deals with additional types of trajectory-based anomalies. These abnormal events take places when a person enters prohibited areas. Those restricted regions are constructed by an online learning algorithm that uses surrounding information, including detected pedestrians and background scenes. Second, a simple data-boosting technique is introduced to overcome a lack of training data; such a problem particularly challenges all previous work, owing to the significantly low frequency of abnormal events. This technique only requires normal trajectories and fundamental information about scenes to increase the amount of training data for both normal and abnormal trajectories. With the increased amount of training data, the conventional abnormal trajectory classifier is able to achieve better prediction accuracy without falling into the over-fitting problem caused by complex learning models. Finally, the proposed framework (which annotates tracks that enter prohibited areas) and a conventional abnormal trajectory detector (using the data-boosting technique) are integrated to form a united detector. Such a detector deals with different types of anomalous trajectories in a hierarchical order. The\u00a0\u2026",
