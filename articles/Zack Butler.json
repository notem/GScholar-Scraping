Our second data set is comprised of semi-structured individual interviews of eight instructors of up to an hour long each. We collected the data across several years as part of our investigation of the use of pencil puzzles as a context for introductory computer science. In an earlier work, we manually analyzed a fraction of the student comments (all data collected until that point), using grounded theory. The results were illuminating, but the process was very time consuming, consisting of manual assignment of a small number of codes to each comment.

However, it is challenging to study the utility of bringing a particular context to computing courses across different types of institutions and student demo- graphics. This is especially true in introductory computing since courses vary widely, for example, in topic order and depth of coverage. In this experience report, we present our approach to, and lessons learned from, studying the efficacy of a specific context for introductory computing assignments across a variety of environments. We focus on the context of pencil puzzles (puzzles like Sudoku or crosswords, designed to be solved on paper using a pencil) and the deployment and fit of pencil-puzzle-based assignments across different institutions' introductory curricula. We describe our overall process, including recruitment of instructors from a variety of institutions\u00a0\u2026"

This study adds to a growing body of research on approaches to encourage adoption by examining the perspectives and advice of successful propagators-education researchers who have had their innovations widely adopted. Drawing on interviews with fourteen CS education researchers, this paper identifies both points of convergence and unique insights across several broad areas: barriers to adoption, the structure of academia, relevant principles of design and techniques for deployment, and strategies for propagation.

I asked,\u201cWhat do you need for Advanced Placement Computer Science?\u201d They told me they needed more multiple choice questions because the AP Computer Science A exam was half multiple choice questions and half free response. And they could buy the Barron\u2019s Book (a study guide) that would just say why the right answer was right, but not why the wrong answer was wrong. They told me that\u2019s one of the things they needed.So, one of the first things I built for teachers was a website where I had multiple choice questions. I tried to make it so that other people could author them too, anonymously. You could say,\u201cI want a test of 40 questions\u201d and it would pull them in randomly from the database of questions.

They had the time and the incentive to create a collection of Peer Instruction materials, which started making its way into their advisors\u2019 classes. That became a game changer. I think that was by far the most important thing in terms of propagation: all those people graduating and taking Peer Instruction to a whole range of institutions was really what made things happen\u00a0\u2026",

Dr. McGill has co-authored several research studies on the state of CS education research [6, 8, 9, 11, 12]. She has also worked on broadening participation in computing [10] and game design curricula [4, 5]. She serves as an Associate Editor for ACM Transactions on Computing Education (ToCE) and chaired the inaugural ACMW North America committee."

So, there were a ton of emails sent asking people to review things. We eventually built a system that looked pretty similar to a journal review process: where we could assign people from within the EngageCSEdu platform to do reviews. So, something would be submitted and we would assign reviews to people with that area of expertise. They were used to that system of accepting or declining the review and having a certain amount of time to complete it. But it was a tremendous amount of effort to get that up and running. BQ: The other thing you should know is that the platform has been rebuilt at least twice from that initial launch.

In this poster, we report on propagation of puzzle-based assignments to many universities and collection of the resulting data from these different contexts. This allows us to study the efficacy of the assignments in these disparate environments. In order to ease adoption at other universities, we are also interested in the experience of the instructors in implementing the assignments in their courses. Our overall goal is to \"close the feedback loop\" by collecting and analyzing all of this data to improve both their effectiveness and adoptability. This\u00a0\u2026"

Research across STEM education has shown that propagation planning is often an overlooked or undervalued part of educational innovation. Whether promoting our own projects or an outside innovation, barriers to success are more difficult to overcome when encountered without sufficient preparation. Plans for adoption and scaling of innovations are not one-size-fits-all, but there are lessons we can learn from both successful and unsuccessful previous projects. We will present a summary of these lessons based on our recent ITiCSE working group research experience on the topic.

We present the domain of pencil puzzles as a context for a variety of introductory CS topics. Pencil puzzles are puzzles typically found in newspapers and magazines, intended to be solved by the reader through the means of deduction, using only a pencil. A well-known example of a pencil puzzle is Sudoku, which has been widely used as a typical backtracking assignment. However, there are dozens of other well-tried and liked pencil puzzles available that naturally induce computational thinking and can be used as context for many CS topics such as arrays, loops, recursion, GUIs, inheritance and graph traversal. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we present a few pencil puzzles and map them to introductory CS concepts that the puzzles can target in an\u00a0\u2026",

Most people use a form of depth-first search, since it has a low (short-term) memory requirement, however, you can easily lose track of which paths you have already tried. Computers don\u2019t have this problem, of course, so a breadth-first search is the usual approach. Of course, humans might use other strategies, such as finding bottlenecks, searching from the end back to the start, or even searching from both directions at once, and we can program these algorithms as well! In all cases, with state-based mazes, the challenge is to make sure you represent your state correctly-a state of the search is not just a vertex of the graph, and the mazes that are easy for people to solve might not be the ones that are easy to program!

We call systems of this type reconfigurable teams. The challenge with such systems is to utilize these capabilities in an effective fashion to complete the given mission. In this work, we describe a behavior-based algorithm and an auction-based algorithm, each inspired by previous work in mobile robot task allocation, to control reconfigurable teams. For each technique, we extend the traditional methods by giving them the ability to utilize the dividing and merging operations to improve efficiency of the overall mission.

In this workshop, we will introduce participants to the vibrant world of pencil puzzles and show how many different types of puzzles can be used for a variety of topics throughout the introductory CS curriculum. Pencil puzzles are those designed to be solved by hand with pencil and paper (such as Sudoku, but including dozens of new types!) that have clear rules and are made to be solved deductively. As such, they are explicitly designed to be easy to understand and intriguing and naturally inspire algorithmic thought. We will explore a variety of on-line\u00a0\u2026"

These interactive robots, or \u201ccorobots\u201d, will operate within the department alongside people while performing tasks as programmed by the students. Here we present the overall system architecture, in which we solve fairly traditional problems but in a robust way that will allow for general use, and a student API which can control the robots at a high level while integrated with arbitrary other code.",

With robots becoming cheaper and more plentiful, personal interactions with them will become more commonplace. This project therefore takes the position that undergraduate computing students need the opportunity to explore core computing concepts in a robotics context. Specifically, we will give students the ability to work alongside teams of highly capable and easily programmable corobots, a term used to identify robots that work side by side with humans, rather than being completely autonomous and isolated. A modular approach is used to incorporate corobotics into various computer science (CS) courses such as first-year computing, networking, and data management, thus permitting the students to see these corobots in multiple contexts.

However, there are many other types of pencil puzzles that can be used as domains for this problem as well as others. By using different puzzle types, the level of difficulty can be varied, the novelty factor can be maintained over time, and a wider variety of assignments in different courses can be created. This paper describes several puzzle-based assignments that have been given in different courses as well as possibilities for even more. Beyond simply suggesting that these particular puzzles can be used for these topics, we propose that investigating the wide variety of puzzle types in existence can be a fruitful and customizable platform for teaching many different topics."

        "description": "In order to more effectively explore a large unknown area, multiple robots may be employed to work cooperatively. When properly done, the group allocates specific portions of the overall exploration task to different robots such that the entire environment is explored with minimal excess effort. In this work, we present a new hierarchical market-based approach to this allocation problem. Our approach builds on standard auction approaches to provide agents with a mechanism to independently form coalitions and to divide a coalition into smaller coalitions in response to the progress of their cooperative exploration process. These coalitions allow a subset of the team to move together efficiently, especially in constrained environments when there are few avenues for exploration. We also present implementation and simulated experiments which show how this natural hierarchy forms and can lead to more\u00a0\u2026",

If a large number of modules is available, they can divide into multiple smaller robots instead of remaining as one large group. In such a case, they must decide based on their mission whether and when such a division is appropriate, and if so, how to divide the mission objectives amongst the smaller robots. Likewise, after division, a later task may be more effectively handled by merging two groups of modules to obtain a single robot with greater capability. For traditional teams of mobile robots, auction-based methods have been used for task allocation with good success. Here we develop an auction approach with new types of bids that incorporate splitting and merging of these robots.

It is implemented by a small animal-borne computer system with a GPS receiver. This approach allows the implementation of virtual paddocks inside a normal physically-fenced paddock. Since the fence lines are virtual they can be moved by programming to meet the needs of animal or land management. This approach enables us to consider animals as agents with natural mobility that are controllable and to apply a vast body of theory in motion planning. In this paper we describe a herd-animal simulator and physical experiments conducted on a small herd of 10 animals using a Smart Collar. The Smart Collar consists of a GPS, PDA, wireless networking and a sound amplifier.

For example, if there is a suspected path through the forest that should be monitored, but its exact location is not known, sensors can be scattered through the area and converge on the path as people or animals are detected on it. In this work, we present several distributed algorithms for sensors to produce this convergence. The first is a robust positioning technique for open rectangular spaces. We also build on this to produce an algorithm for arbitrary connected spaces. In addition, we consider sensors that are inherently constrained in their motion, such as tethered sensors fixed to a single line of motion.

In this paper, we introduce a generic model for lattice-based                 self-reconfigurable robots and present several generic locomotion algorithms that                 use this model. The algorithms presented here are inspired by cellular automata,                 using geometric rules to control module actions. The actuation model used is a                 general one, assuming only that modules can generally move over the surface of a                 group of modules. These algorithms can then be instantiated onto a variety of                 particular systems. Correctness proofs of many of the rule sets are also given for                 the generic geometry; this analysis can carry over to the instantiated algorithms to                 provide different systems\u00a0\u2026",

Endowing such sensor units with mobility can allow them to reactively converge on more interesting portions of their environment. This enables the concentration of sensing resources where they are most useful and provides robustness by delivering redundancy at the point of interest. However, when converging, in general the sensors should not leave any portion of the environment unsensed. In this paper, we review distributed methods for controlling the sensors and describe a family of distributed methods for retaining coverage while allowing the convergence to proceed where possible. The coverage methods are based on the Voronoi diagram of the sensors' positions, and can use different amounts of communication and computation to produce complete coverage of the environment.

Augmenting sensor networks with motion can exploit this surplus to enhance sensing while also improving the network's lifetime and reliability. Sensor mobility allows better coverage in areas where events occur frequently. Another use of mobility comes about if the specific area of interest (within a larger area) is unknown during deployment. We've developed distributed algorithms for mobile-sensor networks to physically react to changes or events in their environment or in the network itself. Distribution supports scalability and robustness during sensing and communication failures. We present two classes of motion-control algorithms that let sensors converge on arbitrary event distributions.

However, allowing modules of varying types, with different sensors, for example, is of practical interest. In this paper, we propose the development of an algorithmic basis for heterogeneous self-reconfiguring systems. We demonstrate algorithmic feasibility by presenting O(n/sup 2/) time centralized and O(n/sup 3/) time decentralized solutions to the reconfiguration problem for n non-identical modules. As our centralized time bound is equal to the best published homogeneous solution, we argue that space, as opposed to time, is the critical resource in the reconfiguration problem. Our results encourage the development both of applications that use heterogeneous self-reconfiguration, and also heterogeneous hardware systems.",

In particular, we show how to perform straight-line motion, turning while on obstacles, climbing over tall obstacles, and tunneling under overhangs, all of which work for groups of arbitrary size. This last feature is important, as it also allows a large system of self-reconfiguring modules to divide up into several groups of various sizes, each of which is equally capable of motion and participation in the overall group task. We also discuss implementations and ways to improve efficiency and switching between tasks.",

In addition, a group of self-reconfiguring modules can divide up into several smaller groups to perform operations (such as exploration) in parallel. In either instance, due to the large number of independent modules in the system, distributed algorithms are highly desirable. In this paper, we describe a set of homogeneous distributed algorithms for self-reconfiguring modular robots that allow division and locomotion in two and three dimensional systems as well as recombination in two dimensions. The algorithms are written in a rule-based style inspired by cellular automata, and allow for the development of correctness analyses, which are also presented here.",

        "description": "Introduction The key research questions in self-reconfiguring robotics are how to design and engineer robot systems capable of self-reconfiguration, and how to plan for such systems. Several interesting robot designs have been proposed [RV01, KR99, MKY+98, TMK+99, FK90, PCSC96, YDR00, SWC99, UK00]. For each of these systems, architecture-dependent algorithms that couple planning to the specific actuation have been proposed. This includes real breakthroughs in both centralized planning [KR99, YMK+00] and decentralized planning [BBR, MYK+01, TMK+99]. This body of work has brought some real insight into planning and control. We believe we are at a point where we can step back and examine more general questions about self-reconfiguration planning in an architecture-independent way. It is important to examine architecture-independent algorithms that can be instantiated to many different systems because they have the potential of providing a more general sciencebase for the field. By outlining general principles for reconfiguration planning, we hope to learn how to better design hardware and control algorithms.In most existing self-reconfiguring robot systems, an individual module can move in general ways relative to a structure of modules, by traveling on the surface of the structure. By composing such movements, it is possible to generate a planner for shape transformation or for locomotion. The details for how to accomplish these goals are architecture-dependent. Automating this process, which is necessary to manage the individual degrees of freedom in robots made of many modules, has been the theme of the\u00a0\u2026",

This paper presents sensor-based coverage algorithms both for a single robot and for a team of independent robots which have been designed to allow for easy integration on to real robots. The specific robots in question are planar robots called couriers, components of the minifactory, an automated assembly system. The couriers have excellent position sensing, which enables them to perform coverage, but have no explicit range or contact sensors to detect boundaries, which adds to the complexity of the coverage algorithm.

A new algorithm, CC/sub R/, is presented here which works for robots with only contact sensing that operate in environments with rectilinear boundaries and obstacles. This algorithm uses a high-level rule-based feedback structure to direct coverage rather than a script in order to facilitate future extensions to a team of independent robots. The outline of a completeness proof of CC/sub R/ is also presented, which shows that it produces coverage of any of a large class of rectilinear environments.

We present the architecture for agile assembly (AAA), a comprehensive integrated framework that is designed to blur these stages together and ease the transitions between them. We have used the protocols of AAA to create an integrated interface tool which can be used throughout the life-cycle of a developing AAA factory, from its design to its operation.

        "description": "Corobots have a potential for numerous applications that are available for educational purposes in the robotics lab for students use. Easily programmable corobots generates opportunities for students to learn robotics and discover their potential. Being inexpensive, the hardware of these corobots limits the detection of obstacles. The challenge is to find a good obstacle avoidance algorithm which would help to fully deploy these corobots. This project proposes and implements an algorithm to find Feasible Motion Directions (FMD) to avoid obstacles which is different from Artificial Potential Field approach. FMD is implemented in static and dynamic environments taking into considerations the issues present in APF. FMD shows improvement over APF by getting out of local minima and passing through narrow passage between nearby obstacles. FMD also tries to solve the oscillation problem of APF."

        "description": "When you solved these mazes, what algorithm were you running? The algorithms that you used are probably not the same ones that a computer would use. Most people use a form of depth-first search, since it has a low (short-term) memory requirement, however, you can easily lose track of which paths you have already tried. Computers don\u2019t have this problem, of course, so a breadth-first search is the usual approach. Of course, humans might use other strategies, such as finding bottlenecks, searching from the end back to the start, or even searching from both directions at once, and we can program these algorithms as well! In all cases, with state-based mazes, the challenge is to make sure you represent your state correctly-a state of the search is not just a vertex of the graph, and the mazes that are easy for people to solve might not be the ones that are easy to program! We\u2019ve posted sample code solutions at\u00a0\u2026"

        "description": "Self-reconfigurable robots are modular robots that can morph into different shapes without outside assistance. The ability to change shape allows these robots to adaptively execute a variety of different tasks, such as locomotion through small passages, climbing tall obstacles, and moving while supporting large payloads, that a single fixed-architecture robot would be incapable of. Self-reconfiguring robots can also function as parallel distributed machines. We consider the self-replication ability in which a large robot can divide itself in several independent smaller robots with the same basic functionality (but not identical size). For example, a system consisting of 100 modules could function as one large robot or 10 smaller robots each consisting of 10 modules, or any number of other configurations. Self-replicating robots are useful in tasks where the overall effectiveness and task completion time is improved by\u00a0\u2026"

BackgroundThe goal of this project is to create a set of laboratory exercises to teach Computer Science students about computer hardware and how to use software to interface with it. Learning about computer hardware and interacting with it from software would be a focus of a course using any of the labs that this project will develop. The labs need to be approachable to Computer Science students. Allowing software to interface with the hardware, rather than having everything done in hardware, provides a familiar ground for Computer Science. A Computer Science student will also likely find algorithms easier to write in software than hardware.There are many published papers with Computer Science courses that utilize computer hardware. One example paper focuses on hardware design with FPGAs [1]. Because of the high configurability of FPGAs, they are good tools for teaching a wide range of computer\u00a0\u2026"
