        "description": "We tackle the atypical challenge of supporting post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and its significant overhead in safety-critical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, dealing with strict overhead and latency restrictions within the limited radio spectrum for V2V. For example, we show that the current use of spectrum to support signature verification in V2V makes it nearly impossible to adopt PQC. Accordingly, we propose a scheduling technique for message signing certificate transmissions (which we find are currently up to 93% redundant) that learns to adaptively reduce the use of radio spectrum. In combination, we design the first integration of PQC and V2V, which satisfies the above stringent constraints given the available spectrum. Specifically, we analyze the three PQ signature algorithms selected for standardization by NIST, as well as XMSS (RFC 8391), and propose a Partially Hybrid authentication protocol\u2014a tailored fusion of classical cryptography and PQC\u2014for use in the V2V ecosystem during the nascent transition period we outline towards fully PQ V2V. Our provably secure protocol efficiently balances security and performance, as demonstrated experimentally with software-defined radios (USRPs), commercial V2V devices, and road traffic and V2V simulators. We show our joint transmission scheduling optimization and Partially Hybrid design are scalable and reliable under realistic conditions, adding a negligible average delay (0.39 ms per message) against the current state-of-the-art.",

Our extensive simulation and over-the-air experiments using show that our classification technique achieves around 85-99% accuracy for SNR levels 0 dB and above.

It is, therefore, possible for an adversary to spoof elements of those unprotected frames at the physical (PHY) or MAC layers, facilitating additional attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle and starvation attacks). Despite a few ad hoc efforts, there is still no practical way to counter these attacks jointly. In this paper, we propose practical schemes to employ cryptography at the PHY layer combined with a time-bound technique to detect and mitigate such attacks in enterprise and 802.1X-based public networks.

To provide fair and effective coexistence in shared frequency bands, both technologies rely on carrier sensing. However, differences in sensing thresholds creates an unfair advantage for 5G nodes who access the shared wireless medium more aggressively and degrade the data rate and latency of Wi-Fi nodes. We show in this paper that an adversary who intends to deny service to Wi-Fi can stealthily exploit this unfairness to drastically reduce the spectrum occupancy and data rate of Wi-Fi nodes. We then propose a novel implicit channel coordination (ICC) approach to mitigate the attack and improve sharing fairness.

The integrity and authenticity of these messages is critical to prevent an adversary from abusing V2V technology to cause a collision, traffic jam, or other unsafe and/or disruptive situations. The IEEE 1609.2 standard (2016) specifies authentication mechanisms for V2V communications that rely on the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) and are therefore not secure against quantum attackers. In this paper, we are the first to devise and evaluate PQC for authenticating messages in IEEE 1609.2. By analyzing the properties of the NIST PQC standardization finalists, as well as XMSS (RFC 8391), we propose three practical, ECDSA-PQ hybrid designs for use during the transition from classical to PQ-secure cryptography.",

In this respect, we aim to study how to break the state-of-the-art modulation obfuscation schemes by applying various machine learning (ML) methods.

        "description": "As the Wi-Fi technology goes through its sixth generation (Wi-Fi 6), there is a growing consensus on the need to support security and coordination functions at the Physical (PHY) layer, beyond traditional functions such as frame detection and rate adaptation. In contrast to the costly approach of extending the PHY-layer header to support new functions (e.g., Target Wake Time field in 802.11ax), we propose to turn a specific part of the frame preamble into a data field while maintaining its primary functions. Specifically, in this paper, we develop a scheme called extensible preamble modulation (ePMod) for the MIMO-based 802.11ac protocol. For each frame, eP-Mod can embed up to 20 bits into the 802.11ac preamble under 1 \u00d7 2 or 2 \u00d7 1 MIMO transmission modes to support the operations of a given PHY-layer function. The proposed scheme enables several promising PHY-layer services, such as PHY-layer\u00a0\u2026",

Relegation is like a fuzzy key revocation by which only the trustworthiness level of a vulnerable but not compromised device is reduced. Inspired by lightweight identity-based signatures, SecureMatch uses public features of a class of devices as their public keys to characterize and relegate all similar devices that share a common vulnerability\u00a0\u2026",

Furthermore, these designs mainly target pairwise rendezvous, and do not intrinsically support multicast rendezvous. Intrinsic multicast rendezvous is required to consistently update the secret information in a multicast group. In this paper, we first design a grid-quorum-based FH algorithm, called NGQFH, for pairwise rendezvous. NGQFH can achieve efficient rendezvous under fast PU dynamics. It is also robust against insider attacks, such as node compromise. Using the uniform k-arbiter and Chinese Remainder Theorem quorum systems, we then propose three multicast rendezvous algorithms, which provide different tradeoffs between the time-to-rendezvous and robustness to node compromise. Our rendezvous algorithms are tailored for asynchronous and heterogeneous DSA networks. To account for fast PU dynamics, we develop an algorithm for adapting the proposed FH designs on the fly. This adaptation is done through efficient mechanisms for channel sensing, assignment, and quorum selection. Our simulations validate the fast rendezvous capability of the proposed algorithms, their PU detection accuracy, and their robustness to insider attacks.",

        "description": "The operation of a wireless network relies extensively on exchanging messages over a universally known channel, referred to as the control channel. The network performance can be severely degraded if a jammer launches a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on such a channel. In this paper, we design quorum-based frequency hopping (FH) algorithms that mitigate DoS attacks on the control channel of an asynchronous ad hoc network. Our algorithms can establish unicast as well as multicast communications under DoS attacks. They are fully distributed, do not incur any additional message exchange overhead, and can work in the absence of node synchronization. Furthermore, the multicast algorithms maintain the multicast group consistency. The efficiency of our algorithms is shown by analysis and simulations.",

        "description": "Establishing communications in a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) network requires communicating nodes to \u201crendezvous\u201d before transmitting their data packets. Frequency hopping (FH) provides an effective method for rendezvousing without relying on a predetermined control channel. FH rendezvous protocols have mainly targeted pairwise rendezvous, using fixed (non-adaptive) FH sequences and assuming a homogeneous spectrum environment, i.e., all nodes perceive the same spectrum opportunities. In this paper, we address these limitations by developing three multicast rendezvous algorithms: AMQFH, CMQFH, and nested-CMQFH. The three algorithms are intended for asynchronous spectrum-heterogeneous DSA networks. They provide different tradeoffs between speed and robustness to node compromise. We use the uniform k-arbiter and the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) quorum systems to\u00a0\u2026",
